Here are some notes concerning some of the solutions for levelset #93.

1.
Level 006 does not seem solvable because there is no EXIT. This is - most
likely - an error in the level. In the included solution I have played a
modified level 006, which has an exit on position (1,1), which is at the
upper left of the level.
[I have even gone so far to use a HEX-editor to search for a 'secret' coding
in the 1440 bytes of the (24 x 60)-level which deviated from the usual set of
41 elements (values 00h - 28h), but found nothing. I assume the author really
forgot to add the EXIT to the level.]

2.
In level 010, a seemingly 'unsolvable' passage is used in the upper-left part.
I suspect that a theoretical possibility exists to get through this without
losing an Infotron, though I have not managed to do this - even on a lower
speed. In the solution I have assumed a level 010 where that Infotron has been
replaced by a green Base on position (7,5), to see if the rest of the level was
solvable 'normally'.

3.
Level 028 starts with a shifting-trick that I only succeeded in 1 out of 20
attempts, also because the starting of a 'recording' of the solution takes
a little bit of time: two Zonks shift a little bit to the right, and then
hang on top of the third, which has to be pushed. This is probably a 'normal'
Supaplex-feature, and has been solved - if not by me, then by others.

4.
Lastly: of the more than 1000 Supaplex levels, these had some really
interesting, complicated puzzles. Too many of the other series contain
speed-related puzzles. Though this is an aspect of Supaplex too, I found it
less fun because for me this game should be mostly about clever thinking -
combined with speed. For some levels I was already satisfied that I solved
them regardless, and paid less attention to the speed. I think that, for
example, level 24 and 26 can be solved minutes faster. Perhaps I will try that
sometime.

I hope these 28 'real', 1 'semi-real' and 1 patch-solutions are useful to you.
