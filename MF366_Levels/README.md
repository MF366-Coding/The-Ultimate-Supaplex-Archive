# You already know me...
...and you know you can call me MF366...

# What's new in The Archive?
New level by D-Train and a new Level Editor, from GitHub, as well as the most recent version of Megaplex, which was not in this Archive. Older releases will still be available in here.

## Some quick info for you guys...
I am currently working on a new Supaplex levelset (a full 111) with some friends of mine. I am already in level 23... Nice!

### Will I post it in The Archive?
Yeah, sure! The Supaplex Archive is supposed to be Ultimate, remember?

# Missing Demos
If you have any demos, please let me know!

# See you in the next release!
I will keep posting some fresh levels and some old levels I might found somewhere in the huge World Wide Web. With all that being said, enjoy Supaplex! See ya...
