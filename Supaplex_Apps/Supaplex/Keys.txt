Keys
----

The following keys can be used in Supaplex:

- Arrow keys
Use these to move Murphy (the little orange fellow) around. 

- Space
If you press (and hold) space, and then press an arrow key, Murphy will eat away an object in that direction (if it's edible). If you just hold space long enough, Murphy will drop a red disk (if he has any). 

- Right shift
Pressing right shift will reveal how many red disks you still have with you. Look in the bottom right corner of the screen. The number that appears there is the number of red disks you have. 

- Enter
Will show/hide the information panel at the bottom of the screen.

- Escape
Quit level (destroy Murphy) and return to the menu screen. 

- j
Recalibrate joystick. 

- p or NumLock
Pause. Note that these are two different pause functions, so if you press "p"to set pause on, you can't turn it off by pressing NumLock, and vice versa. (Talk about confusing...) 

- More keys
Please refer to the SpeedFix documentation (SPFIX63.DOC) for more information about the additional keys that only work in the SpeedFix version of Supaplex.
