This is a simple DOS-based level editor for the game SupaPlex.

It uses the files LEVELS.LST and LEVELS.DAT which it will update
if you choose to save the level you've edited. So those are the 
files that you may want to backup before trying this software :). 
Also if those files doesn't exist in the directory where the program 
is it won't even start.

User interface is simple enough to work with without any descriptions
if you've been playing the game. In case you haven't, now it's time to.

This is the first (and very much likely the last) release of this 
software. The original version was written in '93-'94 within few weeks 
and forgotten almost as fast. Since then the only changes were 
translating the Help-screen from Finnish to English and simultaneously
do some minor fixes to interface.

The program is freeware, so have fun. 
And to make it sure: I won't take any responsibility of anything done 
by or with this software... As you probably knew :).
