This is Suaplex level editor 1.0b document file you are reading now.

Supaplex level editor written by Ahti Legonkov from LC SoppWare Inc.

How to use this program?

Using supaplex level editor is easy and I think it is real obvios. To edit
your levels.dat the progrm must be is the same dorectory as your supaplex
is. Once you have started the program you will see a box in the middle of
the screen where you can select the level to edit. For moving the cursor
there are cursor keys. And for selecting the file is an enter key.

When you are in level editing mode you can get help on keys by pressing F1.

After you have done your editing the program will create a directory LEVELS
of one does not exist and saves the selected level in file level.xx.
To make the level available in game there is a little utility called addlev.
This is made in case you do not want the level you have made to be in your
levels.dat file. If you are sure about this use addlev.

usage of addlev:
addlev <level number>

 * there must be levels.dat and levels\levels.xxx in current directory.
   This means that this program has to be in the directory where your supaplex 
   is.
  * there has to be exactly 1 command line parameter.
  * value of the parameter must be in range 1..111.

Enjoy editing levels!
