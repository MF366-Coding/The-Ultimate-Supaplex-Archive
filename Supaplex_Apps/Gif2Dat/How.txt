How to edit .Gif files for gif2Dat?

 I use Microsoft Paint for editing .Gif files for Gif2Dat.
 
 Palette:
  Each Supaplex .dat graphics file has his own palette.
  That's why you must use the same colours I use in my sample
  .Gif files.

 Fixed.dat:

  Edit fixed.dat in two lines
  One line of 20 sprites (Each sprite is 16*16)
  Edit the 2nd line also that way.
   Between those lines you have to make one line.

 Moving.dat:
 
  You can use my program SPMOV to edit this file.
