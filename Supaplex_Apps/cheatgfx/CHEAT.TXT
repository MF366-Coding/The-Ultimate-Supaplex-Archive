To use these 'cheaters' graphics, backup your original MOVING.DAT and
FIXED.DAT files (if you ever want to use the original graphics again) and
copy these ones over the old ones.

Some of the changes:
 - You can clearly see bugs, since they have now a different color base.
 - Murphies that do not play are colored blue
