Adding a Signature with SPSIG
-----------------------------
As you may have read on the Supaplex page at http://www.bd-fans.com (in the Solutions section),
you can create signature text files. Just follow the instructions on the website until you have
a SIGNATUR.txt file ready.

Now you would like to attach this signature file to your demo recording. You should use the following
commandline option while starting up SPSIG: 'SPSIG.EXE A DEMOn.BIN SIGNATUR.TXT'. Both the demo file 
and the signature file must be in the directory of SPSIG.

If you don't know how commandline options work, you should have a look in the Download section of the 
Classic Supaplex page at http://www.bd-fans.com.
