Run SPLAUNCH.EXE to use the program.

The first thing you should do is to set the executable name to the full path
to the SpeedFix executable (you can use the "browse" button to browse to it.

You can use the "save config" to save the config to the registry (to make
sure you have the same options next time you run SPLAUNCH.)

Note: DO NOT USE LONG FILENAMES for the "play file" option, as the SpeedFix
can't handle them!

NEW IN VERSION 1.1:
 - Fixed "levelset" selection. It wouldn't work before (it would use the
   levelNUMBER for levelset, no matter which levelset you chose.)

Have fun!
