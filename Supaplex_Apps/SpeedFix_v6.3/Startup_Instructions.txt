Supaplex Startup Instructions
-----------------------------
To start Supaplex, simply run the executable spfix63.exe which can be found in the Supaplex directory.

It might me useful to create a shortcut if you are playing the game in Windows. To do this, you need to
take the following steps:

- Click with the right mouse button on spfix63.exe in the Supaplex directory. 
- Select 'make a shortcut' in the popup window.
- Now there will appear a new file in the Supaplex directory: 'shortcut to spfix63.exe'.
- Right-click on it an select 'cut'.
- Now to the desktop and right-click somewhere on an empty space and click on 'paste'.
- Right-click on the new desktop item and select 'change name'.
- Change the name of the shortcut into 'Supaplex' or something else.

To have a better performance of Supaplex in Windows, you could try the Windows XP instructions on
dosgames.com. Find it here: http://www.dosgames.com/xphints.php

If you want to use certain features in Supaplex, you need to use commandline options. To find these options,
see spfix63.doc in the Supaplex directory. To start the game with commandline options, I recommend to use
SPLaunch. You can find it on the Supaplex page of my website.
