      ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN PRESENTS
	  
	      "RETURN TO PROMOTEK"
	      A SUPAPLEX LEVEL SET
		  
		       ALL LEVELS
	     DESIGNED BY ALTERMAVEN
----------------------------------------

interesting{dot]output|AT|gmail[dot}com

All levels designed by Altermaven.

     FOR FREE, NON-COMMERCIAL USE.
           BY THIS I MEAN...

YOU MAY:
- use this levelset for personal use
- include this levelset in a bundle for
  distribution with a free Supaplex port
- record and stream gameplay of this
  levelset, provided you acknowledge me,
  Altermaven, as the author of the set

YOU MAY NOT:
- include this level set as part of a
  commercial or "freemium" Supaplex port
  - "freemium" means free but comes with
    purchase options/microtransactions.
- modify this levelset without explicit
  permission from me

I HAVE THE RIGHT TO:
- instruct you to remove my level set
  from your compilation if it part of a
  commercial or "freemium" port
- request app stores to remove the
  offending material if not resolved
  
REPORT TO EMAIL IF:
- you find an upload missing this README
- you find this package in a commercial
  or "freemium" port's distribution
  - please also forward the author's
    email in your report and report the
	app to the distribution medium as
	having an add-on w/o author's perms
- spam email not discussing anything
  regarding this levelset will be
  discarded without reading. Your mail
  may also be filtered if offensive.
- email with attachments are auto-sent
  to delete. Please don't attach.
  
Without further ado. Hopefully my ass is
covered and you are legit.
----------------------------------------

TO USE:

IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE SPEEDFIX, BUT
THE ORIGINAL SUPAPLEX EXECUTABLE,
please copy LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT, then
move these files to a safe directory.
Then copy LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT from
the archive to the Supaplex directory.
Start Supaplex at DOS prompt.

IF YOU ARE USING THE SPEEDFIX, OR ARE
USING OPENSUPAPLEX, you can rename
LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT to L?? and D??
where ?? is a number that not used.
Click the DISK icon until the LEVELSET
number of this levelset is seen.
Otherwise, follow above.

IF YOU ARE USING MEGAPLEX, access Options
and choose to restrict view size to default
Supaplex. This is for maximum enjoyment.
Open "LEVELS.DAT" from the File menu,
preferably situated in a directory other
than the SUPAPLEX main directory.

IF YOU ARE USING A COMMERCIAL PORT, sorry
I cannot help you. I do not know how to
add levels, and I offer no support.

----------------------------------------
Putting this levelset into a commercial
or freemium distribution is considered
a CRIMINAL offense in the court of law.

ISSUE: PROMOTEK RESOLUTION
ISSUER: DR. I NOAH FEUTHEENGS
DATE: 02 SEP 2130
MESSAGE:

The data you had given me had truly been
quite the bounty! Unfortunately, after
peering through all the information, I
am afraid the rabbit hole goes deeper than
we have originally anticipated. The machine
you worked on wasn't exactly the faulting
system. Alchemosa's out of the shop, but
we found that the true problem lies in
a place known as Facility 131 -- one of
Promotek's off-site laboratories. The
whole project governing the hyper-
dimensional tweaking lies in a machine
designated simply as "Experiment 4",
operated by one Dr. Yldab Pudewercsi.

I hope you didn't pack up MURPHY,
because you'll be needing it again.

We thought the incident to be resolved.

It was just the tip of the iceberg.

I got the feeling Dr. Pudewercsi won't
make it easy for us, so I hope you've
honed in on some extra tricks while our
last communication happened.
At least we'll g!#$^T(!#@*$()%^Q--
