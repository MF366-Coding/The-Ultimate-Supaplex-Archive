RE: RETURN TO PROMOTEK
ISSUER: ASSISTANT DR I. NOAH FEUTHEENGS
DATE 04 SEP 2130
MESSAGE:

Dr. Pudewercsi didn't fully lock me out of
the communications, so I was actually able
to glean what you might encounter during
your troubleshooting of Experiment 4.

Again, this is the machine that is causing
the hyperdimensional outbreak, so this is not
going to be as easy as the prior Promotek Incident.

If you don't want to know the knowledge of what you
are about to face, I suggest you discard this memo
posthaste. But if you find yourself in a little bit
of a pickle, I figured I might lend you a hint or
two.

Best of luck,
I. Noah Feutheengs

'I TRULY DID NOT THINK YOU COULD PULL IT OFF!!'
'YOU WIN, I LOSE!!'

Gathering all the data you needed, you find the
main system control panel of Facility 131. Using
the codes you are given, you patch in the poke
codes for the panel's main frame and hit the
execute button. Ceremoniously, Dr. Pudewercsi's
systems all crash one by one, writing all forms
of corrupt data on the system's drives, causing
the operating systems to refuse to work.

However, with the data you've obtained, the
Promotek Incident is truly resolved, and you
prepare what you've gleaned with Noah, who in
turn would make a case to end Dr. Pudewercsi's
career -- and that of Promotek -- permanently.

However, Dr. Pudewercsi would be found with
ozone coming out of his head with a frizzled
wire connected to a jackport. Turns out he got
hit with the trip as the response of the codes,
but it couldn't be traced to you. Promotek,
however, is forced to fold, and the next day,
dimensional parameters snap back to their
original configuration.

It's a blue sky, sunny day. You try to find
out the result of what happened to Promotek...

But somehow, Promotek didn't exist at all?

You pack up MURPHY, but you leave your tel line
open, in the hopes Noah might give you another
job. It's not easy being a bug hunter ace...
