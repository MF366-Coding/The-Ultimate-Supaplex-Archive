RE: BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM
ISSUER: ASSISTANT DR I. NOAH FEUTHEENGS
DATE 04 AUG 2130
MESSAGE:

Greetings. I know Ima Alchemosa might be somewhat of
a prickly individual and because of his tartiness,
16383 testers couldn't fix what happened to our
primary laboratory relay. However, I have peered
into the general schematics of his proposed
'gauntlet' and the fact he made it out of various
contained 'dimensions' is the reason this is
happening.

If you don't want to know the knowledge of what you
are about to face, I suggest you discard this memo
posthaste. But if you find yourself in a little bit
of a pickle, I figured I might lend you a hint or
two.

Happy Testing,
I. Noah Feutheengs

070 "-- TAUTOLOGICAL STOP --" RT
This is what happens when you replace the bugs in "MINEFIELDS!"
with zonks. I had to shift the playfield a little bit in SPEDIT
so it could be solveable.
Tautology is the study of repetitive nature. But I think
repeatedly studying the repetitive nature of repeating things
is quite repetitive indeed.
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting
different results, after all, is it not?

071 "-- PSEUDOMAGICAL BOP --" TZ
What is it with these nonsensical titles. I expected better from
Dr. Alchemosa but.. ahem, right, where was we..

You have to shift the presented object in such a way that you
can clear the middle of the field without being trapped!

082 "---- SORTIERANLAGE ----" TZ
You need only 255 infotrons. There are exactly 27 extra.

a lot of zonk shifting here!

"You monster..
THE TESTING IS NOW OVER.
YOU ARE NOW A BUG HUNTER ACE!"

Yay! The primary lab relay machine is fixed! Let's go find
out what hap--oh, you were right after all. Again, a Blue
Screen of Death, followed by some reality glitching, turns
the machine into a final LEVEL! Get to work, MURPHY!

111 "-- TIME TO UNPLUG IT --"
Let's really crash Dr. Ima Alchemosa's primary lab relay,
which is actually a laptop, that indeed bluescreened the
moment you solved the entire goddamned mess, and reality
glitched into a level upon the laboratory's floor. Maybe
the infotrons here can help shut down Promotech!

-------------------------------
The epilogue

Well, you found that he's been a mad scientist and the whole
thing regarding the testing is a gig. Thankfully, you
now have your own portable testing system, and Dr. Alchemosa
has been driven out of business and locked away to the
point he will never use a machine again. Satisfied, but
feeling your work was not at all proper, you refuse the
money handout and, you take a moment of them not looking
to stash the device.

Turns out 'everyone' was but a robot clone of Dr. Alchemosa,
except for I. Noah Feutheengs who was really your partner
in crime that helped you with the Supaplex incident.

The moment Dr. Alchemosa was extracted and the rest of the
machinery smashed, the clones disappeared. Time dials back
to the present. You feel good. Even Dr. Alchemosa himself
disappeared.

You finally have it! Your new shiny MURPHY Tester!

...or was it all a dream?
