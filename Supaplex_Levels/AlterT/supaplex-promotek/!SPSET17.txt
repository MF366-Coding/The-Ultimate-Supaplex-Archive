RE: BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM
ISSUER: DR. IMA ALCHEMOSA, PROMOTEK LABS
DATE: 04 AUG 2130
MESSAGE:

CONGRATULATIONS!
You have been selected as one of the
individuals who may now participate in
the use of the Modular User-Responsive
Portable, HYperdimensional (MURPHY)
Tester System! You will be put to your
ambidexterital skill as you will show
our trained observants how well you
can use the MURPHY Tester to solve one
of our biggest gauntlets.

It so happens to be our primary
laboratory relay that needs testing, and
after 16,383 individuals who had shown no
promise, we have decided you might be the
lucky individual who will not only be
able to fix our machine with the use of
the MURPHY Tester, but be able to finally
finish deciphering what our relay was
reading in the first place that caused
this grand mess.

If you finish this test with flying
colours, you will not only be certified
as a MURPHY Tester Ace, but with your
newfound skills, can be deployed to fix
the machines of the world with your new
device! Consider it payment for your job.
----------------------------------------
Considering you have indeed managed to
fix the Supaplex Mainframe with a
standard MURPHY Tester system which was
not handed to you upon finishing, your
dreams of becoming a MURPHY Tester Ace
may yet be realised. But why would such
an incompetent corporation such as
Promotek want you to troubleshoot their
primary lab relay? And what the hell
were they looking for, anyway?

You accept the job, since nobody else
is going to..

After all, isn't it going to BSOD anyway?
----------------------------------------

TO USE:

* Please place LEVEL.L17 and LEVELS.D17
into the directory that contains both
LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT. This is usually
your base Supaplex directory, if you have
chosen to run either DOSbox Supaplex,
Megaplex, or OpenSupaplex.

IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE SPEEDFIX, BUT
THE ORIGINAL SUPAPLEX EXECUTABLE,
please copy LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT, then
move these files to a safe directory.
Then, rename LEVEL.L17 to LEVEL.LST and
LEVELS.D17 to LEVELS.DAT.
Start Supaplex at DOS prompt.

IF YOU ARE USING THE SPEEDFIX, OR ARE
USING OPENSUPAPLEX, click the DISK icon to
switch to LEVELSET 17.

IF YOU ARE USING MEGAPLEX, access Options
and choose to restrict view size to default
Supaplex. This is for maximum enjoyment.
Open "LEVELS.D17" from the menu.

IF YOU ARE USING A COMMERCIAL PORT, please
feel bad because you have been scammed.
There is no legitimate difference between
SPEEDFIX/Megaplex/OpenSupaplex and the
commercial variant. None. Nata. I cannot
support you.

Remember, "Commercial" means either paid
or "freemium". READ DISCLAIMER AT TOP.
----------------------------------------
Now you have accessed your shiny new
levelset, please have fun solving.
However, if you need a nudge, please
read HINTFILE.txt for helpful details from
your partner in crime who is using the
alias "I. Noah Feutheengs".

Some basic trick knowledge is recommended
to fully complete this levelset. Please
look up videos on how to complete these
tricks:

Snik Dodging -- shifting MURPHY as an enemy
is about to make contact, forcing it to turn.

Disk Jumping -- placing a red disk and using
the resulting explosion to reach a ledge in
a gravity environment.

Zonk shifting -- using the zonk moving
behavior to your advantage.

Explosion chaining -- starting a chain by
creating a fuse and then setting off an
explosion at the start of it -- usually
an Electron explosion which then creates
a series of infotron explosions.

With practice and a bit of persistence,
you will be able to complete this levelset.

Have fun!
