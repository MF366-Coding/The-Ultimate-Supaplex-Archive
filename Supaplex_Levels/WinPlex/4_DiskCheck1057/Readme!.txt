Important Installation Notes: 
----------------------------
This product requires the VB6 Runtime, which should be downloaded from Microsoft at:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp5/WIN98Me/EN-US/vbrun60sp5.exe (1 MB)

Please install the runtime before running the program. In some cases you may be prompted to reboot once after installing the runtime.

[ Some systems may not need the runtime or have it already installed. If you get any errors when starting the program, the missing runtime is likely to be the cause. ]

Win95 users: Good news - The program MAY run on Win95 too. There is no obvious reason it shouldn't. So you may try cause there is a good chance it may work. We did not test on Win95 because its so obsolete right now.

WinXP and above, users: Good news - The program may run on XP and above without the need to install the vb runtime because it comes with the operating system.
