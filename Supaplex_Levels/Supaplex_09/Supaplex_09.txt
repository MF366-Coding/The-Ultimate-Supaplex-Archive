This textfile accompanies the LEVELS.D09 and LEVEL.L09 files. These three
files come together in the archive SPLVLS09.ZIP and may be distributed for
free, as long as the original files are left unchanged and they stay together
in one archive.

Be sure to check out the Supaplex Webpage too! You can find it at
http://www.elmerproductions.com/sp or you can do a websearch for "Supaplex"
if you can't find it.

The Supaplex page contains lots of software, new levels (including the latest
version of this, and other collections), solutions and more. Everything about
Supaplex.

There are two ways to enjoy these levels:
 - If you have the Supaplex Speed-Fix (by Herman Perk, you can download it
   from my Supaplex page, see above) you can use certain commandline options
   to use these datafiles directly. All you have to do is copy LEVELS.D09 and
   LEVEL.L09 to your Supaplex directory, and use the proper SpeedFix option.
 - If you do not have the Supaplex Speed-Fix you must first make a backup
   copy of LEVELS.DAT and LEVEL.LST (which came with the original Supaplex)
   then, you simply copy LEVELS.D09 to LEVELS.DAT and LEVEL.L09 to LEVEL.LST
   and you're ready to play.

Please note that the levels do not appear in order of difficulty, but in the
order in which I received them. You might want to edit the PLAYER.LST file
so you can start any level right away (or use the SpeedFix '#' option).

If you want to create your own levels, try out the Supaplex Level Editor. You
can find it on my Supaplex webpage (see above)
