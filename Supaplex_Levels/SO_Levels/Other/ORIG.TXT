Information About Supaplex Level Set 97

Somewhere in the internet I found the Windows game "Mr Matt".
This is a shareware game with registration fee of $16,- and is crippled
if not registred.

It has many similarities with Supaplex and BoulderDash, but only knows very
few objects: Space, Earth, MrMatt, Stone, Apple   , Wall
Supaplex:    Space, Base , Murphy, Zonk , Infotron, Hard Wall.

(Apples can be Carrots or Hamburgers if a different graphics set is chosen.)

Differences between Mr Matt and Supaplex:

- There is no Exit: The game ends automatically if ALL Apples are eaten.

- Apples (Infotrons) never fall: they act as Bases, but must be eaten ALL.

- Stones never slide off of anything if they are not actively falling:
  A pile stays even without supporting earth around it, until a lower Stone
  is able to fall down or is pushed.  All Stones above that will fall and
  slide if possible (first to the left until blocked, then to the right).
  They only slide off of other Stones, and not from Earth, Apples or Walls.

- For sliding Stones Mr Matt acts as Space: if he walks underneath such a
  free pile of two Stones from right to left with no Space underneath him, he
  is killed by the upper Stone (if at that moment there is Space above him).
  Murphy lives because he acts as an obstacle for such a sliding Zonk.

- Mr Matt cannot eat without moving (like Murphy with the space key pressed),
  but he can push Stones the same as Murphy can push Zonks.

- Mr Matt cannot run away from falling Stones: if he is underneath a Stone or
  a pile of Stones, he is killed if he moves down: He may only move sideward,
  but is killed if another Stone of that falling pile slides off on his head.
  This death cannot be avoided by just running away as Murphy can.
  (There is a game option in Mr Matt: "no stupid moves" which switches off
  the possibility of moving down if he stands underneath a Stone.)


This means there are several translation problems, but we can try anyway.

We cannot change those differences between Zonks vs. Stones and Infotrons vs.
Apples.

I translated the missing Exit by changing all Walls to Exits.
This way Murphy may end his journey wherever he can and still finish the game.

Another restriction: Supaplex can only count to 255 Infotrons to eat.
There is one level with over 255 Apples (Harvest has 288).
I suggest that all Infotrons must be eaten anyway for an acceptable solution
of that level, if that level can be solved that way (I didn't try yet).

Mr Matt's levels come in separate level files, of which each seem to contain
different gradations of difficulty of the same idea.

The order in which I put those separate files in this level-set is random, so
easy "level files" may follow difficult "level files".

I don't know if all translated levels can be solved in Supaplex, although I
did solve levels 1 to 7, which look as if those are among the most difficult.
(It took me some time to solve level 6 and 7 though, but I can prove it.)

My opinion about these levels: A new refreshing aspect to Supaplex.

Have fun too,
