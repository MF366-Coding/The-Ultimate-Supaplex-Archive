Information about the Supaplex levelset 98:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once I found the PC game Boulderoid, which is said to be seen as an
introduction to Boulderdash.
I extracted all MAP (text-)files, which I packed in a separate ZIP file here.
With a small program I converted all those MAP files to Supaplex levels.
Since not all levels could be solved in Supaplex, these have been altered
where necessary. So the levels in BLDRMAPS.ZIP are the original levels from
Boulderoid, the levels in LEVELS.D98 are adapted for Supaplex. All are
solvable.
Also all levels from Rockford's Revenge seem to be here. (Those were password-
protected, but it didn't take long to crack that and extract those maps too.)

The numbers behind the Supaplex level names are the times in seconds in which
the puzzles had to be solved.  I wanted to keep this information in Supaplex.
(See also the MAP files in the ZIP.)

Have fun,

Following information has been extracted from Boulderoid (V1.15) for the PC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Gameplay
Boulderoid is a combination puzzle action game.
You are a character called Rockford.
A game is set out as a sequence of caves.
To complete a cave Rockford must collect a set amount of diamonds in a set
amount of time, which are different from cave to cave.
Extra diamonds are worth bonus points.
Having the diamonds triggers an exit an Rockford must find this to enter the
next cave.  Bonus lives are given at intervals of a set score.
Occasionally (once every five caves - Original Boulderdash) intermissions
occur.  They play the same as normal games but you only get one attempt at
completing them:
If you die, you don't lose a life you just proceed to the next level.
If you complete it you are given a bonus life.
Caves are made up of many entities that help and hinder your efforts to
complete the cave.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Variables
Each cave is specified with a different set of properties like maximum time,
speed of moving objects, amoeba growing speed, percentage of the cave an
amoeba is allowed to grow, and many more.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Space
Rockford is free to move through space.
See	BUTTERFLY
	FIREFLY
	CRAZYFORD
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Dirt
Rockford may move freely through dirt, leaving a tunnel of  SPACE behind.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Rock
Rocks block Rockfords progress.
He may, with effort, push them or undermine them until they fall.
Rocks fall whenever there is SPACE below them.
Falling rocks kill ROCKFORD, CRAZYFORD, FIREFLY and BUTTERFLY entities.
See	UNSTABLE
	AMOEBE
	SLIME
	MAGIC WALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Diamond
Rockford must collect sufficient diamonds to trigger the exit and escape the
cave.  Diamonds will slide off unstable places.
A falling dianond has the same effect as a ROCK.
See	EXIT
	GAMEPLAY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Hard Wall
This structure is indestructible and usually forms the exterior of the cave.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Wall
These structures block Rockfords progress but can be destroyed by an explosion.
See	UNSTABLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Magic Wall
The Magic wall looks like an ordinary wall until a rock or diamond falls on it.
Rocks falling onto a magic wall will emerge as diamonds and vice versa.
See	ROCK
	DIAMOND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Hexpanding Wall
This wall will expand to fill a SPACE on either ist left or right.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Vexpanding Wall
Expands to fill any space above or below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Expanding Wall
This wall will expand into any SPACE around it.
Premiering in Boulderoid.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Entry
This marks the point where Rockford will enter the cave.
Note that you may have multiple entry points and hence multiple Rockfords.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Exit
Rockfords way out of the cave.
The exit only becomes active when sufficient diamonds have been collected.
See	DIAMOND
	GAMEPLAY
* Note exits are destructible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Hidden Exit
This exit will not signal ist presence, it will remain looking like a HARD
WALL after being activated. Rockford must find it after completing the cave.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Amoeba
Amoeba grows to fill free SPACE and DIRT.
When it can't grow any further it mutates into diamonds.
However if the amoeba grows to fill a set percentage of the cave it will turn
to rock.  Butterflies and fireflies die on contact.
See	ROCK
	DIAMOND
	BUTTERFLY
	FIREFLY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Slime
Diamonds and rocks are able to permeate through this substance.
The rate they fall through is set separately for each cave.
See	VARIABLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Butterfly
Butterflies are lethal and if destroyed form diamonds.
Butterflies move through SPACE to rotate clockwise.
They can have any of four starting directions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Firefly
Fireflies are lethal.
They move only through SPACE and always try to rotate anti-clockwise.
They can have any of four starting directions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Monolith
Kills ROCKFORD, CRAZYFORD, FIREFLY and BUTTERFLY entities on contact and is
indestructible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Tri-Nitro-Toluene
Drop rocks on it or use a nearby explosions chain reaction to trigger a
mighty explosion.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Fuse
Drop something on, or explode something next to a fuse to trigger it.
Premiering in Boulderoid.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Glue
Anything that moves into glue will become frozen solid.
Premiered in Rockford's Revenge as a quirk of the C64 Construction Kit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Acid
It is almost instant death for anything that enters acid.
Premiering in Boulderoid.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Crazyford
Rockford's slightly insane relative.
Crazyford will destroy diamonds(!) always progressing forward.
A random decision to change direction is made when progress is hindered.
Premiering in Boulderoid.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Teleport
Teleport to other areas of the cave.
Destinations and attributes are defined per cave.
Premiering in Boulderoid.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Dumbford
Rockfords alter ego.  If Dumbford dies so does Rockford.
Dumbford however can be eliminated indirectly by an explosion.
With no personal loss.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Unstable Places
In these places if SPACE exists beside them and one above that an entity that
is susceptible will slide across to eventually fall into the space beside.
The following are unstable.
	WALL
	ROCK
	DIAMOND
The following are susceptible
	ROCK
	DIAMOND
