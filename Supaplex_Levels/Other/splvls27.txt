I received these levels by e-mail September 28, 2004, anonymously (except for
the initials DVB.)

All demos were MPX files, which I converted to SP files by removing the
first 20 bytes. Three demos do not finish properly: 93, 104 and 107
I renamed those original -not finishing- demos with minus signs:

DVB093--.SP
DVB104--.SP
DVB107--.SP

I made finishing demos of those three levels plus one extra of level 52.

DVB052HP.SP Now with 18 extra Infotrons eaten.
DVB093HP.SP All Infotrons eaten, a lot more than necessary.
DVB104HP.SP All Infotrons eaten, a lot more than necessary.
DVB104H1.SP Just finishes, leaving many Infotrons = beginning of DVB104HP.SP.
DVB107HP.SP Using the same idea as DVB, but now finishing properly.

The complete level file was called LEVELS.DVB, which I renamed to LEVELS.D27
and added LEVEL.L27, just for completeness.

Have fun
