logic_1.sp to logic_20.sp - various logic-focused levels I made before.
Except for the last one (which is a bit meh), all of them were released before.
Some are small, some are large, but none require tricks/glitches.
Note that I don't always remember all of the solutions. It's been a long time.

b_again.sp - not my level, but so good I wanted to include it.
Made by geoo89, who usually makes trick-focused levels... but this one isn't.
A great logical puzzle, feels like a "Brainman"/"Find Your Way" hybrid.

trick_1 and trick_2.sp - two trick-focused levels.
SP Online has them as Muzozavr_begin.sp and Muzozavr_mirror.sp
For the first one, if you know basic tricks from Elmer Productions, you're good to go. Second level involves more advanced stuff.
If you know what you're doing, the timing isn't too hard in these.
I included them to demonstrate what I mean by tricks used as a part of *puzzles*, not just "trick showcases".
