about tough nut


alright, so I've finally polished up that idea I had... the "KMS + Kufterin + my own puzzle design skills" one

the timing isn't too difficult (although I tested it with CTRL+W/CTRL+L because there are a few mildly hairy moments, but nothing like a geoo level), but puzzle-wise, I believe I've finally made a monster truly worthy of KMS, geoo, Mirek and the others... many, many years after the original forums went down :smile:
there might be loopholes, so if anyone solves this, I'd want to see how just to make sure I didn't miss anything stupidly obvious, but the intended solution does work :wink: and, hopefully, isn't too obvious
might not seem too tough, but looks can be deceiving
