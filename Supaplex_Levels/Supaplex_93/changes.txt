Supaplex 93 (WN1)
-----------------

While recording solutions, Alphons te Beek experienced some problems in this levelset.
He made a few changes.These notes concerning some of the solutions for levelset #93 are by 
Alphons te Beek. It has been transalted by Maarten Egmond.

1.
Level 006 does not seem solvable because there is no EXIT. This is - most
likely - an error in the level. In the included solution I have played a
modified level 006, which has an exit on position (1,1), which is at the
upper left of the level.
[I have even gone so far to use a HEX-editor to search for a 'secret' coding
in the 1440 bytes of the (24 x 60)-level which deviated from the usual set of
41 elements (values 00h - 28h), but found nothing. I assume the author really
forgot to add the EXIT to the level.]

2.
In level 010, a seemingly 'unsolvable' passage is used in the upper-left part.
I suspect that a theoretical possibility exists to get through this without
losing an Infotron, though I have not managed to do this - even on a lower
speed. In the solution I have assumed a level 010 where that Infotron has been
replaced by a green Base on position (7,5), to see if the rest of the level was
solvable 'normally'.

3.
Level 028 starts with a shifting-trick that I only succeeded in 1 out of 20
attempts, also because the starting of a 'recording' of the solution takes
a little bit of time: two Zonks shift a little bit to the right, and then
hang on top of the third, which has to be pushed. This is probably a 'normal'
Supaplex-feature, and has been solved - if not by me, then by others.

4.
Of the more than 1000 Supaplex levels, these had some really
interesting, complicated puzzles. Too many of the other series contain
speed-related puzzles. Though this is an aspect of Supaplex too, I found it
less fun because for me this game should be mostly about clever thinking -
combined with speed. For some levels I was already satisfied that I solved
them regardless, and paid less attention to the speed. I think that, for
example, level 24 and 26 can be solved minutes faster. Perhaps I will try that
sometime.

5.
adden an exit to level 042

6. 
added an exit to level 050.

7.
An exit has been added to level 060.

8. 
In level 078 some green bases have been added in the part of the level with gravity, 
because that part of the level was impossible to solve.
