I received these levels by e-mail September 28, 2004, anonymously (except for
the initials DVB.)

Subject:        New levels for SUPAPLEX

Message body:   Present from Russia

All demos were MPX files, which I converted to SP files by removing the
first 20 bytes. Three demos do not finish properly: 93, 104 and 107

The complete level file was called LEVELS.DVB, which I renamed to LEVELS.D27
and added LEVEL.L27, just for completeness.

Have fun
