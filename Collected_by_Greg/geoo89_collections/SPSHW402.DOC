------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      INSTUCTIONS FOR USE:
                      -------------------

Copy at least SUPASHOW.EXE, SUPASHOW.INI and SUPASHOW.DAT to your Supaplex
directory and just start the program.  Read and do what it says on screen.
Note: The difference between "smart" and "dumb" (just start the program ...):
Smart means that all levels that are equal with it's previous level are not
shown (="EMPTY" levels of the SpEdit level editor of Maarten (Elmer) Egmond).
Smart also means, with the Infotron splitted levels (LEVELS.D99), that all
parts of all splitted levels are placed on screen in their relative positions,
so that a better impression of those levels is presented (I hope).
Dumb means that none of such "smartness" is applied.


The main files of this package are SUPASHOW.EXE, .INI and .DAT.
The other files are either demonstration files for SUPASHOW (LEVELS.D99), or
for playing those levels (LEVELS.D99 and LEVEL.L99), or for people who don't
like the result of SUPASHOW and therefore want to modify SUPASHOW.DAT 
(SPRITES.EXE), or for programmers who want to use some of my stuff either
immediately (SUPA_ASM.OBJ and SUPASHOW.DAT) or indirectly (SUPA_ASM.ASM).


SUPASHOW.EXE is the main program of this package: view and launch Supaplex
levels.  (You need ca. 500kb free memory to be able to launch Supaplex.)
SP files and extended format SP files (with a demo riding piggyback on the SP
file) can be launched with the space key too!  See version info below.
Furthermore, the D key does the same as the space key, but starts the SpeedFix
(version 3 and above) in Debug mode (if you want to do Demo recording etc.)
The E key starts Spedit.  Read the SUPASHOW.INI file for details.
Be aware, that you might not be able to launch Supaplex/SpeedFix from Spedit
due to memory shortage.


SUPASHOW.INI only contains calls to the Speedfix 6.x (or lower, or higher),
and to SPEDIT.  It also tells SupaShow, which level set is free for use, and
which files to display (LEVELS.D??, DEMO?.B??, *.SP).
All the rest of that file describes how and what, and about anything else
that you can tell SUPASHOW to do: please read SUPASHOW.INI!


SUPASHOW.DAT contains numbers, numbers and numbers, and a description.
The end of SUPASHOW.DAT explains what those numbers mean, and how to edit
the look of the Supaplex mini sprites and/or colors.


After editing SUPASHOW.DAT you might want to have a close look at the edited
sprites, and that is where SPRITES.EXE should be called.  It shows all sprites
in several sizes (enlarged too, so you don't need a microscope to see which
pixel might be wrong).  That is the only thing this program does.

If you want to make a program which uses the SUPASHOW.DAT file, you are
invited to do so (and send me a free copy of your program).
I've included an example ASM file with lots of information inside for
such programmers.  These routines are written for QuickBasic 4.x, but are
easily changed to integrate into other languages too.  Read the ASM.

For those programmers who still use QuickBasic (version 4.x) I've included
the ready-to-link SUPA_ASM.OBJ file.  (Not everyone has an assembler ...)
See the SUPA_ASM.ASM file for more information.

LEVELS.D99 and LEVEL.L99 are the complete level works of Dave Peck, who wrote
Infotron on the Macintosh.  Thanks to his information I was able to convert
his files to the Supaplex format.  Infotron uses a variable game field size
of 120*120 sprites.  Supaplex uses a fixed game field size of 60*24 sprites.
The levels that were larger than 60*24 are split into several levels and
cannot be played.  I marked those levels with different names: those all start
and end with different characters than the usual minus signs, and contain
information about which part of the whole level that levelpiece is.
Due to differences between both games, some of the 'small' levels cannot be
finished: in Infotron Murphy runs faster than the other moving objecs or
chain explosions.  Infotron also has 4 different initial directions for
scissors, which could not be converted.  This also creates problems in several
levels: the scissors do not move in Supaplex as they do in Infotron.
To play those levels anyway, either rename these files to LEVELS.DAT and
LEVEL.LST, or use my Supaplex SpeedFix V4.0 with at least the parameter !99.
I translated the largest level (SEEING YELLOW) to a playable Supaplex level
and the result is level 111. All features are matched exactly.

Maarten's level set 01 contains all playable levels from this set, as far as
those are no exact copies of original Supaplex levels.
There is only one small difference: the levels in level set 01 are taken from
a preliminary conversion that I'd send him.  The levels are identical but his
nice-looking hardware is not matching the original Infotron hardware.
Level set 99 matches Infotron as close as possible.  (All hardware - nice or
dull - is indestructable, and as such it makes no difference.)

SPECIAL.SP can be seen as a demo level for the new SupaShow cheat mode.
(This is exactly the same level as SPECIAL1.SP from Maarten's page.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  HOW TO INTERPRET CHEAT CODES:
                  ----------------------------

If you change the fifth line of SUPASHOW.INI to read CHEAT, you will see
strange things happen in special ports (formerly called gravitation ports).
If you look with SPRITES.EXE at the last line of the sprites contained in
SUPASHOW.DAT, you will see ports with a square patch of white and black
inside, arranged as follows (W=white, B=black):
  BW
  WW
The black part tells us that we deal with a special port.  That black part
never changes. It serves as an optical reference to the three white parts.
Now it comes:
Each of those 3 white parts is showing one of the 3 port properties:

  Top left:    (always black)   Top right:    Gravitation

  Bottom left: Frozen Zonks     Bottom right: Frozen Snik-Snaks/Electrons

SupaShow 4.0 is programmed to: LEAVE WHITE if the port switches the property
to ON when Murphy passes that port, and to OVERWRITE it with the corresponding
RED/GREY parts of the standard ports (=the ports that have no properties) if
the port switches the property to OFF when Murphy passes that port.

Now there are 3 different properties, which means 8 different combinations.
All 3 properties can independently be set at will by the level designer.

Example1 (the dash means that that part of the port looks like a normal port.)
  BW
  --
The black part is only the marker, and gives us some help to which white
property we are dealing with: Gravitation is switching on, BUT ALSO:
Frozen Zonks AND Frozen Snik-Snaks/Electrons ARE SWITCHING OFF! (They move!)

Example2:
  B-
  WW
The black part is only the marker. Bottom left is white: Zonks will be frozen.
Bottom right is white: Snik-Snaks/Electrons will be frozen.
BUT ALSO:  Gravitation IS SWITCHING OFF!

Example3:
  B- 
  --
The black part is only the marker and the port just looks like a standard port
with a small black hole in it: ALL 3 PROPERTIES ARE SWITCHING OFF!

Example4:
  BW 
  WW
The black part is only the marker. All 3 properties are switching ON!

NB: This last situation can ALSO mean: The level is corrupt: the port has
no entry in the small "special port database" at the end of each level,
which implies that the port just reacts as any normal port without affecting
any property.  Just play the level and you'll know!
Levels like these can only be produced with "bad" level editors that do not
limit the number of special ports to 10 (which is the maximum number of
database entries), or that do not handle the special ports properly.
(Also fiddling with a hex-editor like Norton's Diskedit, or Maarten's Zapit
can produce these unspecified ports in levels.)

        HISTORY (see last items for the most recent changes):
        ----------------------------------------------------

SUPASHOW.EXE started with version 1.7 since there were no public releases
of all the previous versions.

All files are unchanged except SUPASHOW.EXE, SUPAMINI.DAT and this README.*
Version 1.8 is mainly a bugfix of 1.7:
- Pressing "1" or "2" in the first screen displayed the line with the file-
  number distorted.  This was a bad looking but just an optical bug.
- Going through the levels with the cursor keys was slowed down by flushing
  all keys before testing for the next key.  This was necessary while if the
  keyboard autorepeat is faster than stepping through the levels and the
  keyboardbuffer became full, the resulting beeps were stopping the process.
  Now all keys but the last key are flushed, so cursor movement is speeded up
  since there is no more wait for the next key of the autorepeat.
- Warning text changed which appears if no Supaplex files are found.
- Slight modifications are made in SUPAMINI.DAT.  Nothing dramatic.

Version 2.0 has one completely new and important feature:
- It is now possible to start playing the level pointed to by the cursor
  by simply pressing the SPACE key. (Launch level)
- Extra file SUPASHOW.INI, which actually contains the call to Supaplex
  SpeedFix version 4, but here you can choose your own preferences.
  Read the text in SUPASHOW.INI for more info.
- The keyassignment has changed, mainly in the intro screen.
  Although it says: +/- = NEXT/PREVIOUS, all cursor keys are also assigned
  to help to change level files in one way or another.  (big/small steps)
  All keys without function do not change the levelfile pointer anymore.
- Now only the ESC key returns to the intro screen (and from there to DOS).
- Cursor now remembers the level when switching between "smart" and "dumb".
- Changes in SUPAMINI.DAT, so gravitation changing ports cannot be recognized
  anymore.  (It is up to you to edit to cheat.)

Version 2.1 can now launch SP levels INCLUDING DEMO's appended to the SP files
- SP files, created by SpEdit, can be launched too now!
  For this to work, SupaShow uses the *.?00 levelset to generate the necessary
  files for SPFIX4.  The SP level is multiplied 111 times to form LEVELS.D00,
  and LEVEL.L00 is generated. All of these scratch files are deleted later.
  Before any old *.?00 is overwritten, those old files are renamed to "*.?~0".
  After returning back to SupaShow, those files are renamed back to *.?00.
  If an SP file is launched, SPFIX4 is started according to SUPASHOW.INI, but
  it will always start in cheat mode.
- NEW!: Any demo information glued "piggyback" to this SP file, is activated
  and connected to the F1 function key! (DEMO0.B00 is generated!)

  The total amount of bytes of all ten demo files of a specific level set
  may not exceed 64010 bytes, and those may be all in one single DEMO0.

  Creating such SP files with piggyback demo information can be done with
  the DOS command:     COPY/B filename.SP + DEMOm.Bnn  newfile.SP
  The m is the ctrl-function key (minus 1) which you used to create the demo.
  The nn is your level set indication: 00 to 99, or IN (the original demo's).

  Example: suppose you have the old format SP file EASY.SP and the demo
  file DEMO3.B03 for that level.  If you want to call the new file EASYDEMO.SP
  then you just type following command on the DOS command line:
        COPY/B EASY.SP+DEMO3.B03 EASYDEMO.SP
  If you want to name the new SP file EASY.SP then   COPY/B EASY.SP+DEMO3.B03
  is enough.  (You will lose the original file EASY.SP then!)
  Do not forget the plus sign, which stands for "concatenate files"!
  Do not forget the "/B", which stands for "binary" file copy!

- This version was meant for Maarten (Elmer) Egmond, to demonstrate the
  possibilities of SpeedFix 4 in combination with his (extended) SP files.
  He never distributed it.

Version 2.2 uses the new SpeedFix 5 parameter to launch (extended) SP files.
REMEMBER: SPFIX5 CANNOT USE THE OLD DEMO FILES ANYMORE: IT USES THE EXTENDED
SP FILES (LEVEL+DEMO) INSTEAD.  THE NEW DEMO?.B?? FILES ARE EXTENDED SP FILES!
- As version 2.1, with added support for the ":file.SP" parameter of SPFIX51.
- The "backup file" names changed from *.?~0 to *.?~~ (see Ver. 2.1 above).
- Previous SpeedFixes, and even Supaplex itself can now play (extended) SP
  files (and new format demo files, but only if those are renamed to *.SP).
  (New format demo files (SpeedFix 5) ARE extended SP files, vice versa!)
  See also SUPASHOW.INI, README.V51 (= Supaplex/SpeedFix "manual") and
  SPEDIT.DOC for more details.
- SupaShow knows now (by the name used in the INI file only), which demo file
  format it must prepare for which SPFIX version, for launching SP files.
- The scratch level set, used by SupaShow, is not fixed to set 00 anymore,
  as in Version 2.1.  It can be chosen in the INI file to be any of 00,..,99,
  or even the standard set, if you want.
- The scratch level set is the standard level set, if no SPFIX4 or SPFIX5 is
  addressed in the INI file.  (Either older SpeedFixes, or renamed new ones)
- Several keys added in the display mode:
  D = launch level in debug mode. Debug is not fixed anymore in the INI file.
  E = launch SPEDIT, and start editing on the launched level (SPEDIT 3.x)
      See the warning in SUPASHOW.INI if you start SPEDIT on a *.SP file!
  4 = set SP launch mode with SPFIX5 to compatible mode (see Ver. 2.1 above).
  5 = set SP launch mode with SPFIX5 to be the new SPFIX5 mode (":file.SP").
      The difference between these modes are, that with a demo attached,
      the "5" mode always starts the demo first.  The "4" mode always starts
      the level, ready to play.  The "5" mode is the default mode with SPFIX5.
- Added more information here and in SUPASHOW.INI: READ THAT FILE TOO!
- The only changed files since version 2.0 are: SUPASHOW.EXE, SUPASHOW.INI
  and this README.220.  All the other files are unchanged.
- Splitted the package into complete file for newcomers, and update package
  for those who have version 2.0, just to save download time.

Version 2.3 is mainly a bugfix of version 2.2, with one extra addition:
- The good old Supaplex can be used too in all cases, not just for SP files!
  (The levels are to be searched in the Supaplex menu then, but the proper
  files are used. PLAYER.LST is NOT updated to allow the level to be played!)
- Bug-fix: Renaming the original level-set works too, now.  This was not yet
  tested, but implemented with an "AT" on the third line of the INI-File.
  Since wildcards were used in the renaming scheme, all DAT files, including
  the other Supaplex DAT files, were renamed.  Supaplex could not start, but
  in the end, everything was correctly changed back: no harm done.
- Renaming scheme (for SpeedFix versions before version 5) has changed
  slightly: only LEVELS.D??, LEVEL.L??, DEMO0.B?? and DEMO1.B?? are renamed
  now, in stead of a wider selection (DEMO?,B??).  See item above.
  DEMO1 is renamed away, so all other demos are disabled.  See INI file too.
- The only changed files since version 2.0 are: SUPASHOW.EXE, SUPASHOW.INI
  and this README.230.  All the other files are unchanged.

Version 2.4 has a few additions over Version 2.3, which make life easier:
- Bugfix: the "demo attached" message in the display sceen for SP files was
  chaned after many keypresses (like 454545454...,) to "no demo attached ...".
  (The number of keys to press was equal to the length of the demo.)
  This was only a screen quirk, but I wanted to fix it anyway.
- Now level names are displayed too!  There was lots of space with SP files,
  but I had to split the level name into 3 pieces in the level-sets ...
- The standard cursor keys in the level-set display now wrap around to the
  next/previous line/column, in stead of stopping at the end/beginning of the
  line/column.  (Up,Down,Left and Right keys only)
  It is now possible to sequentially scan through all 111 levels with the
  Down key only, and a reverse scan with the Up key only.
- The default call to the SpeedFix changed to call the most recent SPFIX52.
  (I forgot to mention these changes in the previous versions above here.)
- The only changed files since version 2.0 are: SUPASHOW.EXE, SUPASHOW.INI
  and this README.240.  All the other files are unchanged.

- SUPASHOW.INI was updated from version 2.3 to read the most recent SpeedFix
  (SPFIX52).  The parameters in the call to this SPFIX52 (the first line of
  that file) is now equal to the default parameter (# only, in stead of #*5).
  (You do not need to reread that whole file if you've read the one from 2.3.)

Version 3.0 now shows DEMO?.B* files too, and a lot of extra info on screen!
- Demo files are extended SP files with SpeedFix 5 and up.
  So why not show those too?  These files show only if SPFIX5 or above is
  used, since only with SPFIX5 and up these files contain the level too!
  If the demo file is shorter than a level, the old demo format is assumed,
  and the file is skipped (but counted):  Please rename those old demo's.
- Since demo times can be extracted from the demo's (with a resolution of
  1/35th of a second!), as I explained Maarten, these times are shown too now.
  Now all "Honoured Solutions" can be compared without playing the demo's.
  Remember: These times are calculated to show the default SpeedFix speed,
  and may vary on different computers (+/- a second or so), depending on
  deviations in the video frame frequency, compared with the system timer.
  (Supaplex reprograms the system timer to run at 50Hz in stead of 18.2Hz,
  which may not be possible in multitasking operating systems: USE DOS!)
  Only these objectively calculated times can be compared, as Maarten does!
- SPFIX53 and up generate SP files, from which the maximum real playing-
  time can be extracted.  This is done by storing the normalized delay value
  (the number of extra delays needed for the standardized speed) and the
  maximum number of delays used when recording the demo in the resulting demo.
  From this the real time can never be extracted if the grey "speedfix keys"
  are used during the recording: only the demo time with the slowest used
  speed (for the whole recording!) can be calculated.
  Too bad there is a bug in SPFIX53, where the slowest used speed is not
  always stored ... SPFIX54 fixes this.
  The calculated maximum time is shown, and when it is certain that it is
  not influenced by that bug, it is shown bright, else it is shown dimmed.
  Both "extra delay" values are shown, together with the resulting factor
  to multiply the time with in order to get the "real" playing speed.
  For more info about these factors: see "footnote" below.
- More info: A green "G" after the level number stands for "Gravity on",
  The number of Infotrons, Electrons and Infotrons-to-eat are also shown now.
  With level files (LEVELS.D??) some path indication is added:
  .\*.DAT means in the active subdir, ?\*.DAT means somewhere else.
- When available, the demo signature can be shown now by pressing <Enter>.
- If an SP file file was shown, there just was too much blabla text.
  This is simplified, but the info may be more implicit now.  Think a little.
  With SP/demo files, a level number may be shown: this is the level number
  at creation time of the demo: the first byte of the demo (like >056).
- When changing from one file to the other, the screen was cleared, which
  resulted in screen flickering when scrolling through the files.
  This has been changed: no clear screen, but screen overwrite.
- Supashow can now handle up to 4000 files, and seems to do that well now.
  A major code revision was needed, which is why this is not version 2.5.
  (Furthermore some complicated code has been simplified, which doesn't show.)
- SP and DEMO files can be played if those are not located in any Supaplex
  directory, and this also now in compatible mode!
  The only drawback: SUPASHOW must reside in a Supaplex directory!
- Starting SpEdit with SP and DEMO files will automatically invoke the
  compatible mode for that call, so the level can be edited immediately.
  This is done since otherwise the original level set was always chosen.
- Although wildcards are used to search for DEMO?.B*, some are excluded:
  The "?" here may only be a digit (0,..,9) and the "*" cannot start
  with an "A" like DEMO0.BAK, DEMO4.BAS etc.  Some Basic packages contain
  DEMO?.BAS, which are to be excluded from the list anyway.
  I found another LEVELS.DAT file with a game called PRINCE OF PERSIA 2,
  but I did not exclude files like those.  That's life ...
- The cursor keys in the first screen have been changed a little, to
  accomodate for those large amounts of files: steps are 1,10,100,1000 now.
- The 4 and 5 keys are now a command line options too, although not shown in
  the first screen. (5 is default anyway, if SPFIX5 or up are used)
- The default call to the SpeedFix changed to call the actual SPFIX54.
- More files are changed since version 2.0: SUPASHOW.EXE, SUPASHOW.INI,
  SUPA_ASM.ASM, SUPA_ASM.OBJ and this README.300.
  Unchanged since ver. 2.0: SUPAMINI.DAT, SPRITES.EXE, LEVELS.D99, LEVEL.L99.

- SUPASHOW.INI was updated from version 2.4 to read the actual SpeedFix
  (SPFIX54), AND a new INI line has been defined!. This line specifies which
  file types are to be viewed, and the order of those types.
  You do not need to reread that whole file if you've read the one from 2.3,
  only the first few lines, since nothing changed after the short description.

Version 3.01 fixes only minor bugs of version 3.0, and as such not called 3.1:
- If a demo was recorded with "Delays: 5,7", the time factor correctly showed
  "2" on the display and the normalized time showed, but the calculated time
  did not appear, which should read the normalized time times 2.
  That problem always occurred when the time factor shows as a single digit.
  This has been fixed. 
- If the Supaplex directory contains many files, one waits rather long before
  something happens.
  A message "Please wait for ATTRIB ..." has been added.
  This also addresses the uncertainty one had of having pressed the dot in
  order to rescan the Supaplex directory:
- Already in 3.0, but not described there: If a level has been created
  with SPEDIT, which was launched by SupaShow, it was not recognized until
  either SupaShow was restarted, or subdirectories were searched and then
  the Supaplex directory again.  This was already fixed in 3.0: after SPEDIT
  returns, you can press the dot (".") in the main menu to rescan the active
  (Supaplex) directory.

- No updates of any files except for this readme.301 and SupaShow.exe
  This readme is unchanged except for this place, the first (header) line,
  and the list of files for updating from version 3.0.

Version 3.02 fixes another little bug of version 3.01:
- If a level file was created with many long level names, the "smart" display
  mode could easily be fooled to think that more levels were part of a single
  larger level, like in levelset 99 (The complete Infotron works of Dave Peck)
  This has been fixed.

- No updates of any files except for this readme.302 and SupaShow.exe
  This readme is unchanged except for this place, the first (header) line,
  and the list of files for updating from version 3.0.
- This version was not officially released.  The fixed bug concerned only me.

Version 4.00 has a lot of changes in many files.  The main added feature is,
that the properties of special ports can be made visible: gravitation on etc.
The unknown features I found in Supaplex (+ SpeedFix) recently just put me to
work to have those shown in SupaShow too.
- Added cheat mode: show all properties of special ports and show hidden walls
  with just the word CHEAT in SUPASHOW.INI.  (Otherwise: no cheat!)
- Added two new configuration lines in SUPASHOW.INI, and updated information
  in that file.  READ THAT FILE!  One line to use cheat mode, and one line
  for inserting a short beep if a displayed level contains special ports.
  This beep is only implemented for special-port hunters.
- Changed SUPAMINI.DAT to support both standard AND cheat mode, and therefore
  it is called SUPASHOW.DAT from now.  (Read info at the end of SUPASHOW.DAT)
- If Zonks are frozen at the start of a level, it now shows with a green "Z"
  after any green "G" (gravitation) after the level number (lower right edge).
- Added a small delay after return from Supaplex/Spedit so any error message
  like "Program too big to fit in memory" can be read now.
- SPRITES.EXE changed to read SUPASHOW.DAT in stead of SUPAMINI.DAT, and to
  show all standard sprites (including hidden wall as blank) followed by
  the 5 modified sprites, adapted to the special built-in cheat mode.
- Updated the menu text to show "Launcher 4.00" and "1997" in stead of
  "Viewer 3.02" and "1996".
- Updated all files to read and use SPFIX60, including the default calls.
  (This SPFIX60 fixes many bugs from SPFIX54 and adds several new features.)
- Renamed README.Vxx to SPSHOW40.DOC with appropriate additions:
- Special "How to interpret cheat codes" paragraph inserted above.
- Changed FREEWARE into (E-)MAIL ware.  See below for more info.
  (There are NO special provisions for this programmed into the software!)

Version 4.01 fixes a few little bugs of version 4.00:
- If a demo was played by a suspicious PC where the automatic speed check
  found a number other than 0 or 5, the text line to show these delay numbers
  was formatted badly and had some useless variables displayed too.
  Stepping to the next demo with such a line would also leave extra characters
  on screen.  This has been fixed.
- If a demo time was over 10 minutes, part of the demo time was overwritten.
  Now there is more space reserved for displaying demo times.
- If the stored number of infotrons to eat was 0, SupaShow showed 0 to eat.
  This was wrong since Supaplex then counts the total of available infotrons.
  Now SupaShow always shows the correct amount, but in case of 0 between "()".
  (Note that if the available amount of infotrons is an exact multiple of 256,
  Supaplex calculates the amount of Infotrons-to-eat to be exactly 0, because
  Supaplex only uses the lower byte of the available total amount.)
- Updated all files to read and use SPFIX61, including the default calls.
  (This SPFIX61 fixes bugs from SPFIX60 plus the "Red-Disk release" bug.)

Version 4.02 fixes a bug of version 4.01, and now the correct SUPASHOW.DAT:
- If the original SUPAPLEX is used in stead of SPFIX61, a demo created with
  SPFIX5+ cannot start.  Since Maarten changed the first byte of the demo part
  of which the highest bit is set now, Supaplex takes an illegal level.
  I forgot to reset this bit in the temporary demo file which SupaShow
  creates in order to start the demo in compatible mode.  This has been fixed.
- If path and file names were too long, they were written on the wrong line.
  Meant is that yellow line below the orange numbers.  This has been fixed.
- Sorry people! With version 4.01 I packaged the wrong SUPASHOW.DAT file!
  It was an old trial version.  The special ports were not showing correctly
  as described above in the "How to interpret cheat codes" paragraph.

       This is the "footnote below" (Referenced by: History at Version 3.0)
       ----------------------------

About Speedfix delay factors:

For slow machines these can only be (depending on the Speedfix value 0..10):

   1, 11/10, 9/8, 7/6, 5/4, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 8/2

For fast machines:

 1/2,  6/10, 5/8, 4/6, 3/4, 2/2, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2

These factors can easily be theoretically calculated, considering that
Supaplex synchronizes on the 70 Hz video frame frequency, and needs two
of those frames per calculation-cycle in order to run at standardized speed.
On fast computers, the calculation is done within one cycle, and due to the
discreteness of the synchronization, it runs exactly double speed.

The Speedfix introduces extra (discrete) delays: it waits for extra video-
frame synchronization pulses (the 70 Hz pulses), and the amount of extra
delays is (for each of the SpeedFix values 0..10):

   0, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

(The fractional amounts of delays are created by inserting one delay every
so many calculation cycles, and taking the mean delay over a large enough
time interval.)

In some notebooks the VGA standard 70Hz is reduced to 60Hz which makes things
even more complicated ...

This package is almost freeware.  My only conditions are:
If you use SupaShow, you MUST send me some (few) words about this product!
(It took me some time to program it, and I don't even know as I write this
line if this program is used and/or if it is appreciated. That's why!)
If you use any of these files for your own programs, I expect to receive
a copy of those programs for free.
