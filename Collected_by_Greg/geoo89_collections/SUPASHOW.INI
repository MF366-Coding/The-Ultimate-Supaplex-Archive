-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUPASHOW.INI file for SUPASHOW v4.02, used for launching Supaplex and SPEDIT.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only the very first 6 lines of this file are significant since SUPASHOW
fetches the first 6 lines only of this INI file for its purpose:

The first line tells SUPASHOW how to call Supaplex/SpeedFix if SPACE or D
are pressed.  See below for details.

The second line: how to call SPEDIT if E is pressed.  See below for details.

The third line: which levelset is free for use for converting an SP file
to Supaplex playable files.  See below for details.

The fourth line: which files and in what order are to be displayed?
This is done with 3 characters:  D=levels.D??, B=demo?.B??, S=filename.Sp.
The order in which those characters appear determines the order in which the
files appear in the display list.  Only the first 3 columns are checked.
If none of D,d,B,b,S or s appear in the first 3 columns of line 4 up here,
DBS is forced, otherwise anything goes: just a D (no demo or SP files) etc.
No more details below, except for the default value.

The fifth line tells SupaShow to use it's own designed cheat mode.
For cheat mode the word CHEAT must start in the first column.
(This cheat mode shows hidden walls and all properties of special ports.)
For more information, read SPSHOW40.DOC
No more details below, except for the default value.

The sixth line: if it reads BEEP, the user is informed with a short beep that
the level contains special ports. Anything else will disable this feature.
This can be used with both cheat mode on and off.
No more details below, except for the default value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first two lines are standard DOS commands, called from within the
directory where the level file or SP file is.
Both lines do not need to be capitalized, but need to start with IF EXIST.
(Even the IF EXIST construction is standard DOS: read the DOS manuals ...)

Although actually not necessary, the IF EXISTs are used by SUPASHOW to verify
the validity of this file, and allow special tricks (see below).

Level-set and level-number parameters are added to these line by SUPASHOW, so
do not add ! and / parameters here: the first of two equal parameters wins.

The launch feature only works if the program called in the first line of this
file is present, and all files necessary for Supaplex to run are available in
the target directory, where the active level file is.
Supaplex, and thus SPFIX.., cannot play levelfiles from different directories.

If you want Supaplex to start in cheat mode (all levels "played") and with
the original speed as without SpeedFix, then you can use:

                   IF EXIST SPFIX61.EXE SPFIX61 #*

All defaults are, if this INI file is missing, or if the lines are empty:

line 1:            IF EXIST SPFIX61.EXE SPFIX61 #
line 2:            IF EXIST SPEDIT.EXE SPEDIT
line 3:            0
line 4:            DBS
line 5:            (no cheat)
line 6:            (no beep)

were the SpeedFix is started in automatic speed adjust mode + cheat mode,
and where Spedit is called the normal way, and level set 00 is free for use.
(Note: *.SP files are always and automatically launched in cheat mode, if
you use SpeedFix 4 or later!)

For SPEDIT: Any cheat mode or initial forced speed is to be set in SPEDIT.CFG.
(See in the SPEDIT package for more information.)  See also warnings below.

Path information can be used like c:\games\sp\spfix61 if the whole game of
Supaplex itself is in the target directory (where the active level file is),
and the SpeedFix exe-file is in a different but fixed directory.  Example:

IF EXIST SUPAPLEX.EXE C:\GAMES\SP\SPEEDFIX\SPFIX61 #D*5

(which means: if the game is there where the level file is, start that game,
but take a different EXE file than SUPAPLEX.EXE itself:
take the SpeedFix file from a different directory but use all the other
Supaplex files where the active level file is.)

DO NOT USE ANY PATH INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE "IF EXIST":
SUPASHOW automatically changes to the target directory before executing this
line, and changes back to the original directory after executing this line.
This is necessary for Supaplex/SpeedFix to play the level file.

For this feature to work you need SUPASHOW version 2.0 or above and also
be aware that ONLY SpeedFix versions 4 and above react on parameters!
Read the SpeedFix' documentation for details about these parameters.
SupaShow recognizes SpeedFix 4, 5, 6 (and above) by the first line of this
file: It needs to contain somewhere on the line SPFIX4, SPFIX5 or SPFIX6 as
in their original names.

Tip: SPFIX4, SPFIX5 and SPFIX6 can be a parameter after the call: it is
     ignored by any SpeedFix since only EGA, D and a filename immediately
     after a ":" are interpreted. As long as it is somewhere on the first
     line, it will let SupaShow think that it needs to use SpeedFix 4/5/6
     demo's and parameters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

About the third line:

SupaShow can play SP files, with and without demo attached, with all versions
of Supaplex and SpeedFix!

If SupaShow finds SPFIX4 somewhere on the first line in this file, and if an
SP file is launched, then it will use the free level set to generate all
necessary files.  LEVELS.D??, LEVEL.L??, DEMO0.B??.
The questionmarks here are taken from the first two characters on the third
line of this file (and legalized to be any of the combinations 00,01,...,99)
(If a single digit is found in the first two characters on the third line,
a 0 is put in front of that digit to form the legal set number 00,..09.
If no digits are found, 00 is taken to be the reserved set number.)
If the level set is in use, it will be renamed to *.?~~ before launching the
SP file, and renamed back when SPFIX4 returns to SupaShow.
(Only if the first two characters on the line are "AT", then the original
Supaplex set is used in this renaming scheme.)
See "In case of emergency" below if you choose a level set that is not free.

If SupaShow finds SPFIX5 or SPFIX6 somewhere on the first line in this file,
and if an SP file is launched, then it will either use the special SPFIX5+
method of launching the SP file (with parameter :filename.SP), or it will use
the method described above (SPFIX4, free level set from line 3 of this file).
You can choose between methods with the keys 4 and 5, in the display screen,
where you launch the SP file. (In the intro screen this is called "SP5 mode")

If SupaShow finds neither of SPFIX4, SPFIX5 or SPFIX6 somewhere on the first
line of this file, the standard level set (LEVELS.DAT, LEVEL.LST, DEMO0.BIN
and DEMO1.BIN) are renamed to *.?~~ before launching the SP file, and renamed
back afterward.  THIS EVEN LETS STANDARD SUPAPLEX PLAY SP FILES AND DEMO'S!

Actually only DEMO0.B?? is renamed/created (in all cases where renaming is
needed) and DEMO1.B?? is renamed too to deactivate any other existing demo's,
to prevent crashes in case you created an overlength demo (> 64010 bytes) with
SpeedFix 5.0 and below.

Be sure not to work with renamed SPFIX files: SupaShow recognizes the SpeedFix
version numbers by (parts of) their names only!  (SPFIX61 contains SPFIX6)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: BE AWARE, THAT SPEEDFIX VERSION 5+ CANNOT BE USED WITH THE STANDARD
SUPAPLEX FILES, BECAUSE THE DEMOFILE FORMAT CHANGED TO INCLUDE THE LEVEL TOO.
(Which means: all DEMO?.B?? are now extended *.SP files: Level+Demo)
This means for SupaShow to work properly with SpeedFix 5.1:  Do NOT rename
SPFIX61.EXE to something without at least SPFIX6 as part of the name!!!
If you changed all demo's to the new SPFIX5+ "standard", do not use the old
SpeedFixes (and the original Supaplex) anymore.  Although nothing can happen,
and no crashes are expected, the demo's just don't work.

WARNING: Launching SPEDIT from an SP file display may not work the wanted way:
SupaShow calls SPEDIT in compatible mode, SPEDIT opens the scratch set,
determined by the third line of this file, and on leaving SPEDIT back to
SupaShow, this complete set is deleted:  Any changes in this set are DELETED.
Be sure to save the changed level in an SP file before leaving SPEDIT then!

WARNING: Overwriting (in SPEDIT) an SP file with demo attached, will delete
the demo information. (Normally you then need to create a new demo anyway.)

WARNING: If anyone uses SPFIX50 and tries to fool Supaplex by copying
LEVELS.DAT to LEVELS.SP, which may logically do no harm (it starts with a
level, followed by lots of bytes, which can be interpreted as a bad demo),
he/she may experience a nice computer crash (which needs a cold boot).
Do upgrade to SPFIX51 or higher if you never want to be surprised by this
kind of crash!  (Anyway, who uses SPFIX50 nowadays?  We are now at SPFIX61.)
The (bad) demo information is too long for SPFIX50 to handle.
Although it was programmed not to crash with extra long demo's, it was never
fully tested with such a file. SPFIX51 or higher fixes this bug.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case of emergency (only if you use a "free levelset" that is not free):

If you happen to be surprised by any crashing Supaplex and SupaShow renamed
some files which are not renamed back due to the crash:
SupaShow restores the old situation after launching any level: it will never
overwrite any *.?~~ file, and restores them back after any successfull return
from the game.  This way any original situation is restored automatically.

(BUT: Do not change the third line of this INI file after a Supaplex-crash:
SupaShow will copy any *.?~~ back to the new level-set, which will be lost!)


Just in case you want to restore the old situation manually:
Copy the files *.?~~ back to their original names, and delete *.?~~ afterward.
DOS doesn't let you rename files if the targets (still) exist.
Better: reserve a level set (*.?00) for SupaShow, so this can never happen.

If the substring SPFIX4, SPFIX5 or SPFIX6 is found in the first line of this
INI file, the renaming scheme (only if the level set already existed!) will be
easy to undo:  in case you used the (default) level set 00 (specified in the
third line of this INI file), just use the DOS commands
     DEL  DEMO0.B00          (for if it exists, and DEMO0.B~~ does not exist)
     COPY *.?~~  *.?00       (use "copy" to overwrite created trash)
     DEL  *.?~~              (we copied, so remove what is trash now)
BE SURE THE 00 IS THE SCRATCH LEVEL SET!  BETTER CHECK TWICE HOW THE THIRD
LINE OF THIS INI-FILE IS SET!

If neither the substring SPFIX4, SPFIX5 nor SPFIX6 is found in the first line
of this file, the renaming scheme with the original set cannot be prevented!
     LEVELS.DAT becomes LEVELS.D~~
     LEVEL.LST  becomes LEVEL.L~~
     DEMO0.BIN  becomes DEMO0.B~~
     DEMO1.BIN  becomes DEMO1.B~~
If Supaplex won't start anymore (after a Supaplex crash!), and you find *.?~~
in the Supaplex directory, copy those files back to their original names,
and delete *.?~~ afterward, as in the example with level-set 00 above.

Don't be afraid: nothing can happen if you use SPFIX4, SPFIX5x or SPFIX6x
together with an unused level set!
In that case, there will be no renaming at all!
