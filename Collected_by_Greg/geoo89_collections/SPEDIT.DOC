Spedit is a program to make your own SUPAPLEX levels. It is very easy to use
and pretty powerful. Now you can distribute your own levels to your friends
all over the world!

The SPEDIT32.ZIP package should contain these files:
  SPEDIT.EXE  - The main program
  SPEDIT.CFG  - Configuration file (you can edit it with a text-editor)
  SPEDIT.VER  - What's new in this and previous versions
  SPEDIT.DOC  - This file
  FILE_ID.DIZ - Short description of SpEdit
  SP2BMP.EXE  - Program to make a 256 color .BMP file from any .SP file.
  SETDEMO.EXE - Program to change the levelnumber for DEMO?.BIN files.
  HONEST.PPL  - List of all people who have registered SpEdit (See section 4)

This document contains nine sections:

0) Important note
1) Basic command tutor
2) Advanced command tutor
3) Technical information
4) Registration
5) Legal stuff
6) Other software from Elmer Productions
7) Troubleshooting
8) How to contact the Author

You should read them in this order, unless you've found a problem already. (In
this unlikely case go directly to section 7: Troubleshooting.)
You may also try to use the program without reading any of this, but I strongly
suggest you don't, because you may get dizzy when you press F1 (=help).

                      -----------------------------------

The Supaplex level editor makes excellent use of some of the features used
in Herman Perk's Supaplex Speed Fix. The speed fix is fully compatible with
the normal Supaplex, but has a lot of useful features. It was originally
meant for those with 386 or higher machines, on which Supaplex runs too
fast, but since it now contains so many features, it's really advisable to
get it anyway.

You can download the SpeedFix from my Supaplex on the WWW:
http://www.stack.nl/~ep/sp/index.html
If the address does not work, check out http://huizen.dds.nl/~ep to see my
current location, or email me at ep@dds.nl
If you don't have access to the WWW, contact me any other way (see section 8)
and I might me able to help you get it.

                    ---------------------------------------
                    =-> SECTION 1 - BASIC COMMAND TUTOR <-=
                    ---------------------------------------

This section contains a tutor for the basic commands. You may print it so you
can try the commands out and read this at the same time.

First, I need to mention something. Supaplex (the game) has some levels with
gravity in it. This can be set in the editor. But the way Supaplex organizes
the gravity-logic, I needed to add a few (new) sprites (some more tubes) to
the Supaplex sprite collection (murphy, hardware, zonks, etc.)
Everybody knows the tubes trough which Murphy can travel. The one-way tubes
have a special feature in the game. Sometimes they turn gravity on or off.
But Supaplex uses the same sprite so you can't see it. This editor uses 8
additional sprites to show it to you.
There are the 4 normal one-way tubes (which don't change gravity) and
additionally there are 4 tubes with 'S ON' and 4 with 'S OFF' written on them.
You can use these as switches to switch gravity on or off. No more than
10 special tubes may be used in any one level (Supaplex restriction) and the
'gravity' setting at the bottom of the screen in the editor is actually the
starting value (when Murphy enters the level).

Before I explain the basic commands, you will have to start the editor first:
If this is the first time you are playing, you should edit SPEDIT.CFG (with
any text-editor) and change the "PATH=" line to the correct path (don't worry
about the other settings) otherwise, SpEdit will not be able to find your
datafiles. Save the file, and exit the text-editor.

Now run SPEDIT. Some lines of text are shown to indicate the programs
initialization. You will see this text if all goes well:

[Top of screen]
BE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP OF THE DATAFILES (LEVELS.D?? AND LEVEL.L??), this
program saves your changes directly to these files!

And REMEMBER THIS PROGRAM IS CARDWARE! DO NOT FORGET TO REGISTER!

Initializing Supaplex Level Editor v3.1:
Max_Undo_Clear=15.
Reading SPEDIT.CFG...
  DOS-Shell: C:\COMMAND.COM
  Supaplex path: C:\GAMES\SUPAPLEX\
  Supaplex commandline: C:\GAMES\SUPAPLEX\SUPAPLEX.EXE &20
  Renaming level-datafile on execution of SUPAPLEX.EXE
  Creating testplayer on execution of SUPAPLEX.EXE

No commandline parameters.

Reading sprites...
Press any key to continue...
[End of text]

A few notes:
 - You should create a backup of the two (or more) datafiles, because the
   editor modifies them (if you save your new level). So if you don't have a
   backup of these, you won't be able to recover the original levels.
 - Registration information can be found in section 4 (Registration) of this
   document.
 - The number behind 'Max_Undo_Clear=' may be different (5-15). This number
   is the total of undo's you can perform on a clear screen/change sprites/
   block put function. (Every time you use one of these functions it will
   be saved to a special undo buffer) The number depends on the amout of
   base memory available.
   (Other (more simple) undo functions can always be undone 1000 steps).
 - Reading SPEDIT.CFG: This file may not exist. That's ok, the editor will
   assume default configuration. You can change this CFG file with any
   ASCII-text editor. (See SPEDIT.CFG for more info on the settings)
 - The lines "DOS-Shell" until "Creating testplayer" may be different,
   depending on your personal settings in SPEDIT.CFG. Normally, you don't
   have to worry about this, but you can always check out SPEDIT.CFG to see
   what it all means (and how to change it)
 - Commandline parameters are discussed in the ADVANCED COMMAND TUTOR.

Now press any key to start the editor. You will first see an 'Elmer
Productions' logo fading in and fading out, after that, the editor will fade
in and you can start editing. The logo can be skipped by pressing ESCAPE
in stead of any other key on startup. Also, pressing a key with the logo
on screen will continue before the delay is over.

The editor screen is made up of four sections:
1) The biggest part of the screen is taken up by the playfield (the level you
   are currently editing). It is at the left-top side of the screen.
2) At the right side of the screen, a few columns with sprites are shown, with
   a fading blue/white box pointer on one of these. This pointer points to the
   selected sprite.
3) The third section are the lines of information at the bottom of the screen.
   From left to right the line displays the title, the number of the dataset
   you are editing (see ADVANCED COMMAND TUTOR) the number of infotrons
   needed to complete the level, gravtiation yes/no, your (the pointers)
   location, and the number of the level you are currently editing.
4) The last section is hidden. It is a popup window used by a lot of different
   functions. When necessary it will pop up from the bottom of the screen.

The most important keys you will use are the Arrow keys (up, down, left and
right). These are used (how did I ever think of that???) to move the pointer
around in the edit window.

Press the left Arrow a few times... See? It works! When you move around a
little more, you can see that once you approach one of the edges, the playfield
will scroll (if there's more level in that direction). This trick also works
if you have a mouse-driver installed. You can move the mouse, and if you get
to the edge, the playfield starts scrolling.

Ok? Then the next important key is Space, because walking across the field is
a fun thing to do, but we DO want to make our own level, right?

Walk back to Murphy and move the pointer on top of him. now press Space (or
move the mouse pointer on top of him and press the left button).
You will see that Murphy has vanished and an empty circuit board appeared!
Great trick, huh? Well actually it is very simple. All the Space key does is
place the selected sprite (the sprite under the pointer in the right window)
under your pointer in the edit window, erasing everything underneath it.

For practice, move around a bit, and 'remove' some more objects by moving on
top of them and pressing space (or using the mouse).

Now, we have a problem. (Don't look in the troubleshooting section!) If we
want to play a level, we'll have to place a Murphy back on the playfield.

This can be accomplished with the help of the Ctrl-Arrow keys (or by clicking
the mouse on one of the sprites in the right window).
Move your eyes over to the right window (not with the Arrow keys!) and press
Ctrl-Right one time. You'll see that the pointer has moved one sprite right. It
covers Murphy. Move the pointer in the editwindow to the position where
Murphy was before (or any other location you fancy) and press Space once more.
Murphy is back now. What a relief! (You can actually put several Murphies in
the playfield, but you can play with only one of them. They make great
decoration though :)

Move around with the Ctrl-Arrow keys some more. You will soon get the hang of
it...

Now you know the very basics of level-editing, see if you can create a little
puzzle or obstacle for Murphy (he really likes these). You'll know what to do.

Lastly, we'll need to save the level. BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE MADE A BACKUP OF
LEVELS.DAT AND LEVEL.LST, BECAUSE THESE WILL BE MODIFIED NOW! Press Ctrl-S
to save your level. You will see the fourth window (the popup window,
remember?) pop up from the bottom of the screen, indicating that your level
has been saved (if you get an error message, something is wrong (you guessed
that) You can try out the TROUBLESHOOTING section, or see if you can fix
the problem yourself.)

Press any key to pop the popup window down. I imagine that you want to see
your level in live action, right? So there are two ways to do that.
 - You can quit the editor (Press Alt-X) and start Supaplex, then choose your
   level and play. This is very much typing...
 - Press Ctrl-A in the editor. Supaplex will be started on two conditions:
    - SUPAPLEX.EXE can be found in the directory specified in SPEDIT.CFG.
      If it can't be found, you'll get an error message. In that case, exit
      SpEdit, and edit the "PATH=" (and "CMDLINE=") line(s) in SPEDIT.CFG so
      they are correctly pointing to your Supaplex.
    - You have enough memory. If you don't, you'll get an error message. In
      that case, exit SpEdit, and try to free up more BASE memory (see your
      DOS-manual for more information about that). You can also try to change
      the SWAPXMS= and SWAPDISK= settings in SPEDIT.CFG, but these should be
      (default) on YES already...
   If Supaplex is started, you'll be able to play your level. If you can't
   access it, don't worry, that's where the TESTPLAYER comes in: move the
   select-player down, until you hit player number 20. He's called TESTPLAY
   and gives you access to any level. Try it... If you are done playing,
   exit Supaplex, and you'll be returned to the editor.

If you are satisfied with your level then you can edit any other one of the
111 by pressing the plus (+) or minus (-) key while editing.

Once you have edited for a short time, I think you will rapidly become used
to the editor.

IMPORTANT: if you edit the border (the outermost sprites) of any level, this
can create strange effects on the game. It is therefore not advised to edit
the border. (BORDER_EDIT can be changed in SPEDIT.CFG or by pressing F5 in the
editor)

                  ------------------------------------------
                  =-> SECTION 2 - ADVANCED COMMAND TUTOR <-=
                  ------------------------------------------

In this section the rest of the commands (Advanced commands) are explained.
If you are not yet familiar with the basic commands, I strongly suggest that
you read Section 1 (Basic command tutor) first. You may get dizzy from reading
about all the commands in this chapter, and many of them are not often used.

Since you are a beginning-advanced user, I won't tell you exactly what to do.
You are probably smart enough to figure it out yourself anyway. Therefore the
descriptions here are shorter.

Tip: This list contains all keys, so it might be handy to print it out as a
quick reference sheet.

"Arrow" means both sets of arrow keys.
"Diagonal" means both sets of Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys.
"Pad" means both Arrow and Diagonal

Key          - What can you do with it
------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Pad - Move the pointer around in the playfield.
    Shift-Pad - Move pointer and place selected sprite at new location.
   Ctrl-Arrow - Change selected sprite (in spritewindow).
Ctrl-Diagonal - Change corresponding corner of red box to current position.
 Alt-Diagonal - jump to corresponding corner of the playfield.
        Space - Place the selected sprite under the pointer in the playfield.
        Enter - Pickup sprite under the pointer to the spritewindow. *
          +/- - Choose level to edit.

       Delete - Place empty sprite (=delsprite, changable in SPEDIT.CFG)
  Ctrl-Insert - Copy current selected blok (red box) to copy-buffer. *
 Shift-Insert - Copy copy-buffer to screen using Paste corner (F7-F10).
 Shift-Delete - Copies contents of red box to copybuffer and then clears the
                red box to delsprite

       Ctrl-A - Start Supaplex from the editor to test your level.
            B - Block put, puts 9 sprites around (and under) the pointer.
            C - Clear entire red box to selected sprite.
       Ctrl-D - DOS shell. See SPEDIT.CFG for more info.
            E - Exchange levels. (switch two levels) *
            F - Search for a sprite.
         H/F1 - Help.
            I - Count total number of Infotrons and Electrons in the playfield.
            K - Clone (copy) other level to current level.
      M+Arrow - Move contents of red box in the direction of the arrow. Sprites
                that fall off on one side of the box are pushed in on the other
                side.
            O - Open another set of level-datafiles. Per default SpEdit will
                edit LEVELS.DAT and LEVEL.LST, but you can open other files
                with this function (LEVELS.D?? and LEVEL.L?? where ?? is a
                number). You can also load other datafiles on startup via the
                commandline (see below). If you want to create a new database,
                just copy LEVELS.DAT and LEVEL.LST to any of the free
                databases, and start editing.
            P - Change all sprites of one kind in another.
            R - Redo last change (after it is undone by pressing 'U').
       Ctrl-S - Save level. *
            T - Change title and number of Infotrons needed. *
            U - Undo last change or move.
            V - Flip red box horizontally.
            W - Flip red box vertically.
            X - Export current level to .SP file (length 1536 bytes) *
            Y - Import .SP file to current level (length 1536 bytes)
        Alt-X - Exit SPEDIT. *

           F1 - Help.
           F2 - Toggle number of rows/information on screen.
           F3 - Search again (for the same sprite as entered with 'F').
           F4 - Search again backwards (use 'F' first).
           F5 - Toggle border editing on/off.
 F7/F8/F9/F10 - Change Paste-corner (Shift-Insert).

* = Not undoable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that Ctrl-A/D/S are the only Ctrl-letter keys. This is done because of
security. These are somewhat sensitive options that might do something you
don't want to do accidentally. Pressing the letter without the Ctrl-key will
popup a reminder message.

If you don't understand what any of these keys do, try them out. As long as
you have made a backup of the affected files, you are safe. If the files get
messed up, you can always restore the original ones.

Then, there are some more handy features which I'll discuss now.

There is a really handy commandline parameter which will allow you to start
editing any level (in stead of level 1) if you are editing in the higher
regions. use: "SPEDIT.EXE /nnn" where nnn is the number of the level.
(Previous versions had the initial slash (/) missing, but I changed this to
be more consistent with Herman Perk's Speed-Fix.)

If you want to edit another dataset (not LEVELS.DAT and LEVEL.LST but
LEVEL.D?? and LEVEL.L?? where ?? is a number) you can do that by using the
'O' option inside the editor, or using: "SPEDIT.EXE !nn" where nn is the
number of the dataset.

Another important (and fun!) part of advanced editing is the use of the
special see-through wall sprite. This sprite has the functionality of a wall
sprite (explodable, non-walkable, zonks won't roll off) but it is completely
invisible in the game. Use this sprite sparingly though, use too much of it,
and the level will be too hard to solve, or not enough fun doing it. (e.g. a
maze of invisible walls can take days to solve, and most supaplexers will
already have given up before that time...)

Also, you can edit SPEDIT.CFG to fit your needs. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE
HERMAN PERK'S SUPAPLEX SPEED FIX, THIS IS RECOMMENDED, IT HAS SOME FEATURES
WHICH MAKE TESTING YOUR LEVELS A LOT EASIER. The file is very self-explanatory,
so you should have no trouble changing it without help. You can edit it with
any text-file-editor.

Lastly: there are two other executables included: SP2BMP.EXE and SETDEMO.EXE.
The first makes a big 256 color BMP file from any .SP file (exported with
SpEdit's X option). This is nice if you want to see what your levels look like.
For more information on how this program works, just execute it without any
commandline options.
The second program has been included to let you use other people's DEMO
files. It will change the levelnumber the demo file operates on, so that if
the level is moved in the LEVELS.DAT file, the demo will still work. To see
how this program works, you can run it (and abort if you don't want to go
on with it)

You can only record a demo if you use Herman Perk's Supaplex Speed Fix (see
section 0 on how to get it). Read the DOC's with the speed fix to read how
to record a demo. If you want to show your demo to your friends, all you
have to do is export the level to an .SP file with the editor, and send it
together with the demo-file (DEMO?.BIN) to your friend. With the editor he'll
be able to load the level, and by using the SETDEMO program on the DEMO?.BIN
file, he can set the demo to run with the right level number. Now there is no
way left to say you've completed all levels unless you have proof! >-)

                  -----------------------------------------
                  =-> SECTION 3 - TECHNICAL INFORMATION <-=
                  -----------------------------------------

This section is meant for those interested in the background of the program.
Also if you know a bit about computers and the editor doesn't seem to work
well, this may help.

I'll begin with thanking Themie Gouthas for making XLIB. It was a great help
to have so much needed commands already programmed. THANKS!

Requirements for SpEdit:
 - of course a PC or compatible computer.
 - VGA screen & card.
 - About 200 Kilobytes free memory, 500 Kilobytes for optimal performance.
   (This must be base memory, the "optimal performance" is actually the number
   of steps you can undo plus the ability to start Supaplex from the editor)
 - A keyboard for user input.
 - Power supply.
 - Just a little intelligence.
 - User activity.
 - A postcard (to Register)
 - A pen (to write the postcard)
 - A valid stamp (to put on the postcard)
 - My address (to send the postcard to, it's in section 4 (Registration))
 - Probably a lot more, if you know anything, write it down on
   that postcard!

(There is no soundcard in the list, because you don't need it, just sing a
song yourself, or turn on the radio!)

Well, enough of that, let's go for the real information:

The program makes use of the mode-X 360x240x256. Therefor it may not work
correctly on some laptops with LCD-VGA, because these will probably show only
part of the screen.

More information is not yet available (I just don't know what to put in here.)
but if you know anything to put in, look at the end of this document for how
you can send me that information.

 - QFF      - A quick file finder which can find almost any file anywhere.
              It searches diskettes, harddisks, cd-roms and other PC-media.
              Features include search for filesize, date, time, attributes
              and special wildcards like [a-z] and *name*. Unfortunately,
              I haven't made it. It is available from Aceton Technology
              (email: aceton@dds.nl or send me mail about it)
 - Supaplex SpeedFix - This 'updated' version of supaplex was made by Herman
              Perk. It's meant to play Supaplex on fast computers (but has
              some very useful features for any computer too!). It seems that
              Some levels can't be solved on high speeds. This program
              fixes that.

   http://www.stack.nl/~ep/sp/index.html for the latest information
   about the programs.

                     -----------------------------------

When you start SUPAPLEX.EXE from the editor (Ctrl-A) or shell to dos (Ctrl-D)
it is possible that you will get an error message. These are:
  File not found
   - Edit SPEDIT.CFG and change the PATH and/or CMDLINE settings. See the
     SpEdit startup-screen to see what exactly SpEdit is trying to execute
     (Supaplex commandline).
  Path not found
   - Edit SPEDIT.CFG and change the PATH setting.
  Access denied
   - This is a tougher one. Are you running SUPAPLEX from a networked drive?
     Maybe someone else is already using the files. Refer to your network-
     documentation for solutions. If you are multitasking, it could be that
     somewhere else a copy of the game is already running. Close that copy
     and try again. If everything fails, try a reboot.
  Invalid handle
   - Check your DOS-manual for more info about this (I have no idea where this
     one can come from)
  Not enough memory
   - SpEdit uses some memory, and SUPAPLEX want to have some too. Since memory
     can only be used for one thing at a time, you need more. Refer to your
     DOS-manual for more info on how to make more free BASE-memory (Try
     MEMMAKER, or a clean-boot) or try changing SPEDIT.CFG settings so that
     memory will be swapped to XMS/DISK or even that undobuffers are destroyed.
  Invalid environment
   - No idea... Check your DOS-manual for this one.
  Invalid format
   - The file you are trying to run probably isn't an executable. Check that.
     Otherwise, check your DOS-manual for more info.
  No more files
   - The computer can't cope with this much files at the same time. Edit
     your CONFIG.SYS and change (or add) the "FILES=xx" line to a higher
     number (FILES=20 should do in most cases, if it's already higher, you
     need to increase it even more...) You can also try to run SpEdit with
     less applications running in the background (if you are multitasking)

Then, there are a few "Unknown" errors. See your DOS-manual (in combination
with the number between the parenthesis) for more information on what's wrong.

If you encounter any problems while doing basic things (like saving your
level, or importing a .SP file) there is probably something wrong with your
harddisk (Bad sector, data error). You'll have to check your harddisk with
a utility suited for that. See your DOS-manual for more info.
If you can replicate the error on another machine (or are certain that the
error is in SpEdit) please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks.

If you are not seeing the entire screen in the editor (you don't see the
right window with all the sprites and the text below) your graphics card or
monitor probably don't support the mode-X I use in the editor. SpEdit should
work with any 100% compatible VGA card and monitor. If you can't use another
card or monitor, there's not really a good solution to this problem.

If your monitor starts emitting high-tone noise (or keeps flickering) your
monitor is probably not 100% VGA compatible. Unless you get a new monitor (or
maybe it could be the graphics card?) you will not be able to use the editor.

That's about it I guess. If you know more information (about SPEDIT) which
should be included in this documentation, send it to me. You may send it
on a postcard (if it's not too much text) or in a letter (if it's not too
much text) or on a floppy disk (if it's not too much text) or else on a
CD-ROM. If that doesn't fit, then don't send it, because I probably won't
include it anyway :)

I now have a service: AUTOMAIL. This will automatically reply your mail.
You can receive more information about this service by sending me an email
with SUBJECT line: AUTOSEND INFO. The body of the message will be ignored.
