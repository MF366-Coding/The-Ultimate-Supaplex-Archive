This archive only contains the executable. In addition, you will need the
files comctl32.ocx, comdlg32.ocx and vb40032.dll. Since a lot of people
already have these files, they were not included in this archive (they're
rather large). You can find these files on a lot of places on the internet.

If you're not sure you have these files, just try to run, and the program
will complain if it can't find any of the files. You can also search your
harddisk for the files (probably in the /WINDOWS or /WINDOWS/SYSTEM directory).
