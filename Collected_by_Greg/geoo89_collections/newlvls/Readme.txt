SONIC.SP was created by Nadim Kobeissi (11 years old). See also SONIC.TXT.


All other levels in this zip were created by Kim Minsoo.

Levels 78S061-X.SP and 78S081-X.SP are alternative demos from Minsoo for those
existing levels.

Daniel was not really pleased to see 78S081-X.SP and answered with a totally
impossible level as "revenge" :-)   (Minsoo was not able to solve it.)

Minsoo in return answered by challenging Daniel to solve a few modified and
new levels: Those are DANIEL?D.SP and are all played by Daniel Perk, just
before and after his 12th birthday (May 23).


Ines Perk (my wife) was in Korea, where she met Kim Minsoo, which accounts for
the special texts inside levels 79S008.SP and 79S009.SP. (Minsoo saw a picture
of Ariane, my 6 year old daughter.)

Level 79S010-D.SP was dedicated to Daniel, as birthday card alternative, with
hint-010.txt as hint. I solved it, but this demo was played by Daniel!
