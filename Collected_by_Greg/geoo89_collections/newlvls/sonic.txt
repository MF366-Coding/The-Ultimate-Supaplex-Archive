hello and thanx for downloading my first supaplex map!!!! :)
yeah, this IS my first supaplex map and this zip only contains one map! (the
other maps are original supaplex maps)
to in stall the map SONIC, make sure you made a backup copy of your level.lst
and levels.dat files beacause the files in the .zip will overwrite these files.

and then unzip SONIC into your supaplex directory
note:when you start supaplex,be sur to scrool the level list to the upper
section, where there is the first map!
other note:this map will replace the map entitled WARMUP!!! 

i must warn you!
this level is VERY HARD!!!! i spent one month making it!!!!!
if you finish it, contact me by e-mail at smogon350@yahoo.com (theres a reward
waiting to be won!!!)

thanx again
Nadim Kobeissi, a 11 yrs old Houmongous supaplex fan!!!
(check if im on mirc on weekends, my nick is SUPREME-VAMPIRE and the channels i
founded are #potterquiz and #supaplex !)
hope you enjoy my map! ;)

Note from Herman Perk:

Above info does not apply anymore, because that single map (=level) is now
sonic.sp, with demo attached.
