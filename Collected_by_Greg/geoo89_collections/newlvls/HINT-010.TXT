I celebrate your 12th birthday, Daniel.

This level has total 121 infotrons, but you only need to eat 114.
So, you can abandon 7 infotrons, if you can't get them all.
Why seven?
See the bottom right part of this level.
Then you will see 8 infotrons enclosed by zonks(rotated letter 'L').
So you need to get through the part. That is the key point here.
Have fun!
