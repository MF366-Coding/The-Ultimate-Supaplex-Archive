------ This file: Comments to Kim Minsoo's level set 78 by: Herman Perk ------

This extremely difficult Supaplex level set 78 (finished April 4, 2002) is
something special. View LEVELS.D78 with SupaShow and you'll get the picture!


Note to level 088:

  See Kim Minsoo's "manual" 78S088.TXT for how to solve this level.

  To level 088 there is no demo available, because the length of such a demo
  would be around 700 kilobyte long, which is way beyond the Supaplex/SpeedFix
  possibilities.  The demo-less 78S088.SP is provided for those who play from
  the separate SP files (like with Megaplex) instead of the level file.

  --- Addition to this note by Frank Schindler: ---
  Actually the demo size is 'only' 471 KByte. MegaPlex does not know the demo
  size limitations of Supaplex/SpeedFix. Hence I added a solution for level 88
  in MegaPlex file format *.mpx.


Note to level 111:

  As with his level set 77, level 111 should also be viewed with an ordinary
  text viewer (Notepad, Wordpad, ...) to see another text message.
  The remark about this being his third set is obviously a typo.  This is his
  second complete set, of course.
  In this level set this level is also playable, which was not really the case
  with level 111 from Minsoo's set 77.


Minsoo's words, taken from an e-mail:

  Finally, I finished creating set 78 with solutions.
  Now I can do things that I piled up behind supaplex.
  I'll not be able to play supa for one or two years.
  But I never quit, and I'll be back with the three-set project.

(That third planned set is supposed to be a normally playable set, although
- knowing Kim Minsoo - it will be something special again.)
