- gravity, freeze zonks, freeze enemies


What is not done yet:
- an object from supaplex named BUG (electro charge in the base)
- play and recording demos
- levels editor ( you can use supaplex levels editors )
- sounds and music
- etc..

'Levels.dat' is original supaplex levels.dat file. So, if you want to play another levelsets, you just need to rename the levelset you wish to play to "levels.dat" and replace file with same name in game dir.

Levels must have original size 60 width, 24 height.
