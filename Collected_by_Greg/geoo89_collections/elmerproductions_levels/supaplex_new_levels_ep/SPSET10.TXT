Welcome to the COMPLETED! version of Supaplex levelset 10.
Inside this levelset, contains 111 levels of my own creation.
These levels were designed using the "Any Level" mode of
Speedfix 6.3 in mind -- or, use Megaplex.

All levels are written in varying difficulty, which means
that if you get truely stumped in one level, go play a
different level and come back to the troublesome one later.

Yes, if you've looked at this levelset 10 earlier in the
levelsets archive, there was a #70 stuffed in there that
wasn't mine. This level was "Through the Pipes" and, sadly,
this was removed so I can get 111 levels in.

However, if you are new to this levelset and wondered what
this mysterious, alternate "Level 070" was, there is a
single-level "PIPES.SP" that is attached to this archive.

All levels up to 69 were built up to 1998; levels 70-111
were built in 2003. The final level, 111, was developed on
October 8, 2003 at 12:01am EDT. Talk about nailing the time!

Special thanks to:

+ Maarten "Elmer" Egmond for SPEDIT,
+ Herman Perk for (I believe) Speedfix 6.3, kill me if I'm
  wrong,
+ Nathan "Noise" Albright, you know who you are.
+ Keri, though that's not her name, actually it's Holly :).
  She taught me the patience required to do these levels.
+ Time for letting me tweak the problems in the new levels.
+ The Half-Quake gang for showing me the true meaning of
  sadism. (http://farm.muddasheep.com/)
+ Frank Schindler for developing Megaplex, which allowed
  me to play the developed levels without problems.

+ ..that guy who wrote "Through the Pipes", I'm gonna be
  in that time and place developing a clever level like
  that someday, we'll just see ;)

short.
