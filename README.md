I also want to talk about Supaplex's history. 
### 🤷‍♂️ What the heck is Supaplex?? 
Supaplex is a puzzle, GUI, tile-based Amiga and DOS old game.
### 🤔 How did it start? 
Two developers started playing BoulderDash, an older game than Supaplex. They were very interested in that and in Comodore Amiga's capabilities. So they tought: let's create a BD clone in Amiga (BD was for Comodore 64).

While one worked on programming, the other started creating levels and sprites. The game launched as Think!, but due to copyright thay had to change the name. And then, Supaplex was born. 
### 🤯 Can I create a level? 
There are lots of Level Editores, but the most recent one made in HTML has connection to Supaplex Online.

### 🌐 Supaplex Online
Supaplex Online is a project that allows you to play SP levels directly from your bowser! It also records demos and saves info on what levels you solved, you didn't, etc. (For that you need an account. Make sure that the part before the @ is the username you want.)

Created a level? Upload it to Supaplex Online (for that you need Discord).

### ❓ How to install? 
Step-by-step guide: start playing this awesome game! 
#### 1️⃣ Option 1: Use Megaplex
There is a big Supaplex clone called Megaplex. You can install it for Windows and emulate it using Wine on Linux. 

(I will add this executable in Pack 4 😁) 

Then, you open a level you have downloaded from here and enjoy it. 
#### 2️⃣ Option 2: Emulate DOS (Windows only) 
You can use a DOS emulator to install the actual Supaplex from 1991.

Pick a level and you are good to go! 
#### 3️⃣ Option 3: Just don't install anything at all... 
Use Supaplex Online, by creating an account (highly recommended) or just playing anonymously. 

Pick a level from thousands of them and you are definitely good to go!!! 
#### 4️⃣ Option 4: Use an open-source clone
OpenSupaplex runs in almost every platform, including PS Vita and Nintendo Switch! Amazing, right?

### 🎮 How to play?
Use the arrow Keys to move.

SpaceBar + arrow Key to snap (get what's next to you without moving).

Hold SpaceBar to drop a Red Disk (and then run away before it explode!).
