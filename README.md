## The History of Supaplex
I also want to talk about Supaplex's history. 
### What the heck is Supaplex?? 
Supaplex is a puzzle, GUI, tile-based Amiga and DOS old game.
### How did it start? 
Two developers started playing BoulderDash, an older game than Supaplex. They were very interested in that and in Comodore Amiga's capabilities. So they tought: let's create a BD clone in Amiga (BD was for Comodore 64).
While one worked on programming, the other started creating levels and sprites. The game launched as Think!, but due to copyright thay had to change the name. And then, Supaplex was born. 
### Can I create a level? 
There are lots of Level Editores, but the most recent one made in HTML has connection to Supaplex Online. 
### Supaplex Online
Supaplex Online is a project that allows you to play SP levels directly from your bowser! It also records demos and saves info on what levels you solved, you didn't, etc. (For that you need an account. Make sure that the part before the @ is the username you want.)
Created a level? Upload it to Supaplex Online (for that you need Discord).
