# üíª The Ultimate Supaplex Archive
## üìÉ Announcement
Due to the Supaplex being such an active community I couldn't find much time to keep this repo up-to-date.

I'm sad to inform you guys, but it will be archived... üò•

Sorry, everyone, for all the trouble. 

The files that had been archived so far will still be here for you guys...

## üë®‚Äçüíª Cool levels made by cool people
Here are their personal Supaplex archives for their own levels and sets:

* [Norb](https://github.com/norbcodes/NorbSupaplexArchive)

* [AlterT](https://github.com/thealtermaven/promotek-supaplex)

## ‚Ñπ Instead go to...
...the official Supaplex Online level archive.

Now, keep in mind that it has so many levels that Greg (the owner of SPOnline) couldn't organize it better than it is now.

But that's fine because it's always updated and it contains SO MANY levels made by the whole SP community.

So, special thanks to Greg and check out the SO Archive.

Download the archive [here](https://supaplex.online/all.zip) or go to https://supaplex.online/all.zip in your browser.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!
There might be some duplicates amongst the files.

And also keep in mind that a level can have a new version that isn't here.

That's because I am archiving the repository for good...

## üìï The History of Supaplex
I also want to talk about Supaplex's history. 

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What the heck is Supaplex?? 
Supaplex is a puzzle, GUI, tile-based Amiga and DOS old game.

### ü§î How did it start? 
Two developers started playing BoulderDash, an older game than Supaplex. They were very interested in that and in Comodore Amiga's capabilities. So they tought: let's create a BD clone in Amiga (BD was for Comodore 64).

While one worked on programming, the other started creating levels and sprites. The game launched as Think!, but due to copyright thay had to change the name. And then, Supaplex was born. 

### ü§Ø Can I create a level? 
There are lots of Level Editores, but the most recent one, fully online, has connection to Supaplex Online. 

By: [Vovan-VE](https://github.com/Vovan-VE/Supaplex-levels-editor) and the actual editor is located [here](https://sple.me).

Enjoy... :+1:

### üåê Supaplex Online
Supaplex Online is a project that allows you to play SP levels directly from your bowser!

It also records demos and saves info on what levels you solved, you didn't, etc. (For that you need an account. Make sure that the part before the @ is the username you want.)

Made a level? Upload it to Supaplex Online (for that you need Discord).

### ‚ùì How to install? 
Step-by-step guide: start playing this awesome game! 

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Option 1: Use Megaplex
There is a big Supaplex clone called Megaplex. You can install it for Windows and emulate it using Wine on Linux.  

Then, you open a level you have downloaded from here and enjoy it. 

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Option 2: Emulate DOS (Windows only) 
You can use a DOS emulator to install the actual Supaplex from 1991.

Pick a level and you are good to go!

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Option 3: Just don't install anything at all... 
Use Supaplex Online, by creating an account (highly recommended) or just playing anonymously. 

Pick a level from thousands of them and you are definitely good to go!!! 

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Option 4: Use an open-source clone
OpenSupaplex runs in almost every platform, including PS Vita and Nintendo Switch (check the quick note down below)! Amazing, right?

### üéÆ How to play?
Use the arrow Keys to move.

SpaceBar + arrow Key to snap (get what's next to you without moving).

Hold SpaceBar to drop a Red Disk (and then run away before it explode!).
