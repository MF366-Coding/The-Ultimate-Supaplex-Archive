FIXED.GIF
MOVING.GIF
FIXED2.GIF

FIXED.GIF and MOVING.GIF are the SUPAPLEX files
FIXED.DAT and MOVING.DAT converted to GIF format.

(The layout of those GIF files is identical with
the layout of the corresponding DAT files.)

FIXED2.GIF is also converted from FIXED.DAT, but
is broken into 2 lines of 20 sprites.

I made MOVING.GIF interlaced for people who want
to put MOVING.GIF as picture on a WEB page.

In MOVING.DAT you can find not only dynamic stuff,
but also things like game field corners and edges,
the patch for restoring the panel where the red
disk counter appears (pressing the right SHIFT),
the (half size) menu mouse cursor, and another
picture of the yellow disk terminal with different
"screen contents".

These files are kept in video memory during the
SUPAPLEX game, which explains the wild surrounding
of the game field if you play with the Supaplex "M"
key in "Debug" mode (see SPEEDFIX documentation).


Have fun!

If anyone is interested in GIF files of the other
graphical SUPAPLEX DAT files, don't hesitate to
ask for it: (E-)mail adress see below.

(There is also information about all SUPAPLEX DAT-
files contained in the QBASIC sources of a very
simple DAT-file viewer I wrote.
If anyone is interested: just ask for it.)
