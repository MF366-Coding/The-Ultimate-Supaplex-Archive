I've taken the liberty to scan the original box of Supaplex, since the game
is already (legally) freely available on the Internet.

I've scanned both the top (box_top.jpg) and the bottom (box_bot.jpg) of the
box I've bought the game in (in 1992.)

The box was printed with full color, so I've scanned it also in full color.
The pictures are scanned with a resolution of 300 DPI.

I chose to use the JPG format to keep the files small, yet high quality.
I've blurred the pictures slightly before saving, since it reduced the size
of the files by a factor 2, without much loss of quality.
