I've taken the liberty to scan the original documentation of Supaplex, since
the game is already (legally) freely available on the Internet.

The original documentation consisted of 10 pages:
 1- 4 = English documentation (included as doc_1.gif .. doc_4.gif)
 5- 8 = German documentation (not included)
    9 = The entry codes (not included)
   10 = A picture similar to the intro screen in Supaplex (doc_10.jpg)

The documentation was in black and white, and so are these pictures.
The pictures are scanned with a resolution of 300 DPI, and all pictures are
1140x1700 pixels large (slightly smaller than the original pages.)

I chose to use the common GIF format as much as possible, but since that
would make page 10 over 1.5MB large I decided to blur it a little, and make
it a JPG file.
